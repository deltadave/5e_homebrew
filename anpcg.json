								"Amazing things happen when talented minds are brought together for a common goal, Adaptable NPCs of the Guild is proof of this! Following in the footsteps of the best selling #AdaptableNPCs line of products produced by the Grim Press, ANPCs of the Guild has surpassed all of our expectations. Tomasz Chistowski's art has been brought to life by over eighteen amazing authors from the DMs Guild, providing unique non-player characters to populate the world of Faerûn!",
								"Contained within this book are 63 unique non-player characters that can serve any number of roles in your player's adventures. Much like the others in its namesake, the ultimate goal of this supplement is to present a repertoire of quest givers and companions that can accompany players on their adventures; being diverse enough to add immersion without introducing unwanted complexity.",
								"Additionally, an engaging Pathway to Adventure called Hero's Quest has been included, written by the talented J.A. Valeur. This quest, designed for four to six characters of 2nd level, uses many of the Adaptable NPCs in this book and can be played upon detailed maps (both DM & Player versions) created specifically for this adventure! Also, the Hero's Quest is fully scalable for higher level play and includes custom quest hooks to drop this adventure into popular WotC campaigns such as Lost Mine of Phandelver, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Storm King's Thunder, and Baldur's Gate: Decent into Avernus."

								"Do your players seek the training of a seasoned armsmaster? Maybe they've been tasked with the need to seek out a retired Red Wizard of Thay to divulge information on one of the many secretive factions across Faerûn! Whatever the quest, the NPCs found within this supplement can serve many roles. With their mixed motivations and alignments, you can be certain that more than a few will be suitable for inclusion as plot drivers in any type of campaign a DM is planning to run. These NPCs can be used as traditional non-player characters by the dungeon masters or controlled by your players as mercenaries for hire. Alternatively, DMs may wish to run these NPCs as adventuring companions, accompanying your players for a short time.",

								"{@b Enlightened or Enraged}. The quest to confront their former allies typically culminates at a point where the abandoned knight must make a choice. Will they become consumed by anger and lash out at those who left them behind? Or maybe their time alone has allowed them to reflect, realizing that everything happens for a reason even though it was not have been immediately evident.

								"Born out of the deceitful union between a fiend and a human, much in the same way as their cambion siblings, agarions retain more of their human parent's appearance. Although their skin has an ashen coloring, missing are the horns, wings, and tails that their kinfolk brandish so proudly. The lack of these features allows agarions to inconspicuously assimilate themselves into many populations throughout the multiverse.",

Deceiving the gullible and twisting the ideals of the noble are favorite pastimes of the agarion, but don't let their enjoyment of these tasks fool you... Agarions rarely act without the underlying motivation of self benefit.",

As with their cambion siblings, it is common knowledge that Graz'zt's fervor for procreation with humanoids has led to the demon lord siring many agarions and cambions alike; those who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. However, unlike the cambions that are viewed primarily as soldiers and henchmen, agarions bread by the Dark Prince's act as infiltrators and assassins. Seeking out high-profile targets and decerning valuable information, or when the time requires it, assassinating those who might oppose their obsidian-skinned begetter.",

								"The armaster has seen more than their fair share of combat, and now most if not all their former companions have passed on. The armsmaster has no patience for those who view war and combat as glorious and will swiftly rebuke those who view war for any less than it is: hell. Their demeanour is gruff and impatient, speaking in barking tones that only the foolish would not heed. But those who listen to the armsmaster may find their skill in battle allows them to breathe for yet another day.",

								"{@b Master Tactician}. In the heat of combat and in the absence of a skilled commander, the armsmaster serves as leader to those around them. The calming presence bolters nearby allies and lends strength to their arms.",
								"{@b Weapons Training}. The armsmaster, having spent countless years mastering use of different weapons, is capable of bestowing even the most inept of adventurers with a fraction of his ability. Through an intensive training regime combined with repetitive exercises and drills, the armsmaster may train a willing and able student in the use of a fighting style of their choice.

								"Large cities are often filled with aspiring mercenaries, hoping to find mentors or take on low level contracts. The contracts that they do get are often close to meaningless; they rarely do more than settle petty squabbles or collect money for low level thugs. Aspiring mercenaries may be hired by adventurers as bodyguards or hired to follow them and thwart their plans. Due to the competitive nature of their work, aspiring mercenaries rarely work together or form alliances – the world of contract work is every person for themselves.",

								"Autumn is a time of transition between the lively growth of summer and the freezing decay of the coming winter. While many people take this time to celebrate the success of a fruitful harvest and to enjoy the company of neighbors before the isolating frosts set in, autumn shepherds thrive in the transition itself, finding power in the balance of nature. They find faith in the transitory nature of all things, rather than in any specific deity, and in doing so can learn to wield powers similar to the most devoted of clerics without ever dedicating themselves to a higher power. Believing it is their duty to draw upon these talents to shepherd others through transitions in life, they are as much at home by a death bed as is in a birthing room, though often welcome in neither.",
								"The autumn shepherd is illusive. Having made peace with both life and death as mere inevitabilities, they rarely feel the need for companionship, preferring instead to connect to the wilderness and its ever-changing seasons. Some rumor that their mastery over the flow of time allows them to move from one autumn to the next without so much as existing during the seasons in between.",
								"When they do have reason to interact with others, autumn shepherds prove to be unnervingly insightful. Their solitude and connections to both life and death make them eccentric.",
								"At the same time, an increased lifespan has given them substantial insight into how other people think. The combined effect is that they are capable of making themselves unnervingly terrifying or incredibly comforting to complete strangers with only a few words.",
								"{@b Unwelcome Presence}. Having made peace with death, the autumn shepherd has no qualms about hastening the demise of those who they believe cannot or should not be saved. This tendency makes them unwelcome in most settlements despite their incredible healing abilities, and it is not uncommon for locals to place a bounty on an autumn shepherd's head should they discover one resides in their area. Further complicating the situation, the autumn shepherd's insight into people's nature gives her uncanny ability to sway crowds, making her presence in populated areas a potential threat to those in power, most of whom are more than happy to vilify them for their association with death. As a result, the autumn shepherd generally avoids other people, choosing instead to live as a hermit in places where nature mirrors the transitional state to which they have devoted themself.",
								"{@b Living in Flux}. The autumn shepherd's most impressive abilities derive from their connection to the very essence of transition. Through incredible training and focus, they have learned not only to make peace with the transitional state of life, but also to bend that transition to their will. If they desire, an autumn shepherd can cause a person's age to advance or regress significantly. Through this talent they are also capable of extending their own life substantially, and some rumor that they can live indefinitely unless violently killed.",
								"Their ability to bestow youth is perhaps the primary reason people choose to seek them out. However, such quests are risky undertakings. There are few autumn shepherds deems worthy of additional years, and many hapless adventurers have believed themselves about to receive such a boon only to find themselves further aged by the autumn shepherd's magic instead.",

However, when they are supplanted by a lesser being, they are less accepting of this behavior. Among celestials, these, usually young, hero worshipers are most commonly known as avenging angels, reflecting their tendency toward revering one among their kind who has been wronged for being right.",
								"In the case of the avenging angel, the object of that worship has changed over the millennia, but since at least 1354 DR it has been, without exception, Zariel – their common name thus shortened to Zariel avenger.",
								"As with their predecessors, Zariel avengers have adopted a romanticized version of Zariel in their words, deeds, and persona. They express their disdain for the celestials who shrink back, while they press the battle against evil forward to where it dwells. While it is unlikely that one would go so far as self-mutilation, it is not uncommon for one to prosthetically adorn their left arm with a vicious weapon. It is rare, but one might shave their head. There are limits to the degree they will go, though, celestials have fantastic hair.",
								"{@b Not so Good}. In the hubris of their relative youth and immortality, they frequently exceed the limits of their wisdom and succumb to temptation and pride. Thus, veiled in the fog of war, Zariel avengers often struggle with their own degree of fallenness, ranging from simple verbal defiance to formalizing evil contracts similar to Zariel’s.",
								"{@b Frontline Fighters}. Zariel avengers gravitate to the frontlines in the battle against evil, where devils court humanoids and where demons erupt from the abyss.",
								"However, given their skill for invisibility and knack for appearing humanoid, they are not easily detected. In recent years, Baldur’s Gate has attracted a large number of attractive foreigners who ask a lot of questions and a greater number of treasure-seekers and adventurers who were last seen in one’s company.",

								"The bee keeper, of course, is different. This hermit has found among the insect swarms of the wilderness what they could not find in humanoid society - a sense of community and wholeness. The bee keeper protects the interests of these often ignored creatures, for they have no other protectors and yet perform fundamentally important duties within the ecosystems of the forest.",
								"{@b Cranky Hermit}. Even among those who live in the woods and prefer to be apart from civilization, the bee keeper stands apart. The bee keeper does not appreciate the druids, rangers and other wanderers in the forest who disdain the tiniest creatures that keep this ecosystem functional. The bee keeper is thus usually less than inclined to interact with other humanoids, often not speaking a word in months or even years.",
								"{@b Swarm Mentality}. The bee keeper sees themselves as part of the swarms they tend. They do not have a strong sense of self and will sacrifice themselves for their swarms if that is the best option to ensure their continued well-being. This mental shift permeates their whole behavior, often referring to themselves in the third person.",
								"{@b Friend of Swarms}. While swarms of beasts are often regarded as dangerous and possibly bound together to act as one by a malicious influence, the bee keeper is on good terms with them. The bee keeper interacts with swarms as easily as other keepers of the wild interact with individual beasts. The bee keeper even attracts swarms of bees and wasps that would not otherwise congregate.",
								"{@b Protector of Swarms}. This strange mutual attraction between the bee keeper and their swarms may be perceived as sinister by some, but the bee keeper does not harbor any ill intent towards others - so long as they leave the swarms of the forest alone. The bee keeper is particularly hostile to anyone who attempts to steal honey from the hives under their protection, cut wood in a part of the forest where ants have made their hills, or root out a nest of giant wasps bothering nearby settlements. The bee keeper considers the activities of the swarms at least as legitimate as the interests of humanoids - and far more worthy of protection, considering the low priority other protectors of the wild favor them with.",
								"{@b Insect Spies}. An ant crawls over an adventurer's boot, a bee buzzes around their head - tiny swarm insects usually go completely unnoticed by the unsuspecting traveler. The bee keeper takes advantage of this by regularly communing with the swarm insects in their domain to learn who passes through the forest. If the bee keeper grows suspicious of anyone, they send out spies specifically to track the potential intruder. Larger groups of travelers, especially when wellarmed or obviously proficient in magic, and travelers from foreign lands particularly arouse the bee keeper's suspicion.",

								"Bladesingers are students of a uniquely elven fighting style, a masterful melding of arcane magic and martial swordplay.",
								"The training they go through is grueling and requires dedication of countless years even by elven standards. The style of a Bladesinger is defensive, they are the last to strike until the perfect opening presents itself. They will dance around near endlessly, letting their opponent grow sloppy, and strike with deadly efficiency.",
								"The nature of their arcane abilities often reflect their martial abilities, prioritising spells that keeps them agile, allows them to close the distance, and ultimately end the fight. All Bladesingers wish to be in the heat of melee conflict, that is where they can flourish and thrive. That is not to say that they cannot work from afar, the toying dance of an archer and a Bladesinger is a sight to behold. With each arrow dodged by the narrowest of margins, as the distance between the two closes, the panic that grows within the archer and the unsettling calm that remains in the Bladeslinger.",
								"Bladesingers come equipped with long slender blades, sometimes in pairs, sometimes those swords are crescent shaped, all depending on their individual tastes. They rarely wear thick suits of armor, opting for reinforced chainmail, or studded leathers to keep them as agile as possible. Most complete their outfit with richly dyed tabards or cloaks, fabrics that twirl and catch the wind as they battle.",
								"Most Bladesingers travel alone, they are solitary defenders of elven domains and go where they are needed. It is rare that any conflict requires more than one Bladesinger, but it is not unheard of.",
								"{@b The Bladesong}. The naming of bladesong stems simply from the combination of a flurry of blade whirls and the arcane chanting of the wielder. The bladesong is both as enchanting as it is dangerous. Most encounters with a Bladesinger begin slow, an occasional clash of blades and elegant dodge. However, as tempers of their opponents grow, as does the tempo of the blades, until there is a final crescendo and the Bladesinger stands victorious.",
								"Some Bladesingers lean heavily into the concept of a Bladesong, openly singing louder than the sounds of battle. It is their war-cry and to those who know, can be just as haunting as they sing with perfect clarity and calm, despite the cleaving wounds they’ve just dealt.",
								"{@b Dancers of Battle}. For anyone who has the privilege of watching a Bladesinger fight it is more akin to a dance than a battle. The Bladesinger is the choreographer and their opponent an unwilling partner, and yet the battle feels meticulously rehearsed. Occasionally, the Bladesigner cuts tauntingly, deep enough to feel, but shallow enough so that the fight may continue.",
								"Most Bladesingers are adept enough to take on three average opponents at once, deftly moving to keep each one scrambling and enraged. Others are said to be able to handle upwards of a dozen enemies, which can all be due to clever use of their surroundings, and a fair share of disorganisation on their opponent’s end. Bladesingers travel alone, meaning they often are outnumbered but very rarely outmatched.",
								"{@b Training in War and Song}. From a young age, bladesingers are taught how to cast their arcane magic while wearing light armor and using martial weapons. More impressive is the performance they put on while doing so.",

This is more than just an adage, for diviners that probe the future too often might fall prey to an insidious curse that renders the wizard blind. With the present firmly locked away from their sight, most of these wizards go mad, tormented by what could have been and what has still yet to pass.",
								"{@b Auspex's Bane}. The origin of the sight-stealing curse is mired in mystery. Some scholars believe it to be loosed by a jealous deity of knowledge. Others lay the blame at the feet of demons, who hunger to make a mockery of every gift given by the gods, especially portents. More than one legend features a powerful hag keen to bestow clairvoyance on a wizard at the inevitable cost of their earthly sight. Despite their aptitude for divination, no blind auspex is able to magically research the origin of the curse; their spells simply fail. This humorless irony has been known to drive an auspex mad.",

								"{@b Obsession}. Every blind auspex obsesses over the very vision that provoked the curse. Try as they might, they must return to that premonition, which they can recall with perfect clarity. Often this premonition is of a personal nature, directly involving those the auspex cares most deeply for: a lover, a child, a kingdom or cause to which they've devoted their lives.",
								"A blind auspex can always be found muttering about this grim portent; messily scrawling it on parchment or drawing it upon clouded mirrors; or preparing for that inevitability—as if they have any chance to alter the future that stole from them everything.",
								"{@b Fatalistic Despair}. A desperate need to thwart the future comes to drive just about every blind auspex. However, after several vain years, the diviner might lose themselves to crushing despair. As this sorrow deepens, they begin to willfully ignore and purposely withhold any good that can be found in the visions that so often visit their minds. Given time, this grim oracle cannot even comprehend these good omens, only the ill. Few listeners can stomach this unceasing tide of woe and soon an auspex might find themselves cloistered to some lonely cloister — far from mirth and men — where they can continue to spin their dark yarns in peace.",
								"To them, life is but a bitter joke, simple and inescapable. If perception truly is reality, none knows it better than the auspex, and if only they would acknowledge that, in the many visions that crowd their mind, there is more than one in which they pull themselves from this pit of despair and return to the world that once welcomed them.",

So they do what successful artisans have always done in perfecting their craft: they practice - and in this case, on other people.",
								"Most often, the test subjects are captured enemies that have attempted (and failed) to assassinate the wizard. Other times, they are hapless innocents, caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time. On rare occasions, a willing and ambitious, if quite foolish, apprentice voluntarily undergoes the experiment hoping to prove fealty towards their master, or perhaps leapfrog them in achieving undeath.",
								"But those aspiring towards lichdom are rarely the fool. The phylactery, into which the subject’s mortal coil is placed, is bound to the wizard’s will, not that of their subject. This results in the formation of a chained wraith rather than the creation of a rival lich - assuming the process is successful, of course. The majority of a necromancer’s early attempts simply end in failure and the death of the subject in question, but those that survive the process become bound into eternal servitude of their new master.",
								"{@b Seething Anger}. A bound wraith typically remembers most, if not all, of its former life. However, the frustration of suddenly having no free will of their own often turns into a burning hatred for the master they must now serve for all eternity. Since they are powerless to act against their master, they unleash their fury at anyone and anything that gets in the way of completing the tasks they have been assigned.",
								"{@b Unwieldy Power}. Regardless of their origin, a bound wraith is never fully prepared for the raw power that accompanies their transformation. Even long after their initiation into the ranks of the undead, outbursts of arcane energy occasionally surge through the tortured soul, causing additional pain and suffering. Whether they are unintended side-effects or purposeful punishments, these wracking seizures diminish the power a bound wraith can wield, thus helping its master establish and maintain dominance.",
								"{@b Phylactery Failsafe}. A wizard bent on immortality leaves nothing to chance. Part of controlling a bound wraith is having the ability to destroy it. Rather than hiding away for safekeeping, they display the phylactery containing the wraith's soul prominently on the creature’s chest, often via a set of magically-imbued chain links.",

Less concerned with gaining personal status and recognition, the bulwark tinker looks to the bigger picture. They know that war is so often a game of attrition, and that good protection, as much as raw power and aggression, can mean the difference between victory and defeat. They also take a more pragmatic worldview, recognizing that while an honorable death on the battlefield might merit rewards in the afterlife, there's nothing wrong with enjoying some rewards in this life either.",
								"{@b Tinkered Treasures}. Often, bulwark tinkers must make do with what is readily available rather than start from scratch with fresh materials. Second-hand metals and used lumber are the staples of their craft. Yet therein lies their genius and the unique niche they fill. Caltrops from broken halberd tips, shields from discarded wagon wheels, ball bearings from a reworked length of chain are all just a day in the life of these non-magical transmuters. They don't simply make things, they make things better, and they create more from less.",

In any event, the defender of justice has taken it upon herself to fight back against the society in which she lives.",

She knows that she is just one person standing against a far more powerful system that will eagerly vilify and crush her if her opposition is discovered. While she has taught herself to defend herself, her goal is not armed conflict. Instead she hopes to disrupt normal operations of the local government in more subtle ways. She might seek to cause an accident along a road, preventing supplies from reaching a destination, or she might make sure that important letters between government officials get lost in transit. She knows that she is operating alone, and she knows that she will only be able to continue so long as she remains hidden. If she is particularly fortunate, she might find an opportunity to hide herself within the very systems she seeks to dismantle, using her innate talents to gain work as a member of the city guard or as a courier for an official, only to use that position to gain access to secure locations or expose ruinous secrets to the common people.",

Often someone meeting her will not discover they have been misled until days later, and even then may not realize that the defender of justice was the reason for their misfortune. While these skills would make her an excellent spy, she is far too distrustful of most established organizations to take on such a role.

One of the most powerful abilities in the defender of justice's arsenal is her ability to simply not draw attention to herself. She is a master of knowing when she is being watched and when she can slip away unnoticed. To further avoid being recognized, she often alters her appearance by changing hair styles or patterns of dress, or by donning face paint likely to distract from her less malleable physical features. She is adept at evading detection and, in the event she is spotted, she is equally adept at avoiding being identified. While not a master of disguise in the traditional sense, she is a chameleon who can appear to belong in almost any place.",

Other bard schools will teach the countless rules for how to structure music or a fight, ironstring bards thrive in the chaos.",

Most marked hunters work in solitude, wishing for the marks on the body to be earned entirely by their own merit, however some believe wholeheartedly in the power of the pack. The markings gathered during a pack hunt are either split or granted upon the one who dealt the killing blow.

								"Of all the different schools of magic in the known realms, the art of pyromancy is among the oldest and most primal. A pyromancer draws on the spark of heat inherent in almost every form of living thing---be it the light of the sun, the warmth of the earth, or the passion buried deep in the caster's own heart, like a miniature volcano waiting to erupt.",
								"Because of its universal nature, most creatures are capable of some form of pyromancy, given the proper tutelage.",
								"This is not to say, however, that the art of pyromancy is simple. Like the flame itself, pyromancy is violent and unpredictable, spreading out of control with the slightest lapse in concentration. Pyromancy draws heavily on its wielder, and without proper discipline, it will rage through the caster's body and consume it like dry tinder. The most accomplished pyromancers have a mantra: \"It is much more difficult to hold a candle than to start a wildfire.\"",
								"{@b Druidic Heritage}. Many of the oldest druidic circles are dedicated to pyromancy and the flame. These circles emphasize the duality of flame: though fire can be a powerful force of destruction, it can also nurture the wielder with warmth and light. The most accomplished of these benevolent circles can perform great and unusual feats with pyromancy, such as purging the body of poison and disease or dispelling enchantments and other shadows over the mind.",
								"However, just as many druidic circles choose to emphasize the violent aspect of flame. These circles ravage the enemies of nature, using fire to decimate crops, fill the air with suffocating smoke, and melt the metal structures and shrines of the civilized world. These druids aren't always evil, but they generally lean towards the chaotic, believing that the imposition of order is a plague on nature---and fire is the most potent cure.",
								"{@b Other Sources}. Although it is the most common source of pyromancy, a relationship with nature is not the only way to procure a mastery of flame. In the field of wizardry, the School of Evocation represents expert control over energy and creation. Many evocationists choose to focus on fire in particular, as its properties surrounding heat and light make it extremely versatile.",
								"On the other hand, many consider pyromancy a dark magical art, and for good reason. Pyromancy is a power gifted to many a cultist or warlock by the masters of the Lower Planes. The most significant example of this phenomenon is the archdevil Mephistopheles, who perverted pyromancy to create hellfire. Mephistopheles distributed this flame to his cultists---sometimes because he believed they were capable of controlling it, but most often because their annihilation at their own hands was amusing to him.",

While they prefer to manipulate and coerce their way into positions of power, often using their alleged godly connections, they become incredibly ruthless when confronted or directly opposed. It is not uncommon for a scorned red witch to attempt to raze an entire town and build a new one in its place with their handful of followers.",
								"Despite their evil nature, a red witch can be an excellent ally - when the terms suit them, of course. They may seek out adventurers to help see their opposition declared heretics, or to take out those who publicly question the red witch’s godly connection. They are rarely straightforward or honest with these requests, however, and are capable of weaving lies and half-truths into convincing tales.",

Due to their talent for manipulation, it is uncommon for common folk to become suspicious of a red witch’s claims. Those who do often disappear, or find themselves mysteriously having a change of heart.",

While most find this kind of magic abhorrent, the witches see no problem using it to get their way. Any ability that blood magic may have to be used benevolently is lost on them; their desire to harness the power of blood is purely for selfish means. A lust for power drives them to use any measures necessary to succeed.",

All of the witches have an arsenal of spells at their disposal, with a focus on bending the minds of others in their favor.

Past trees, foliage, and the abandoned ruins of an old tollhouse, you can discern two figures standing in the middle of a rickety bridge spanning a deep ravine.

								"“Tell me everything you know about the tomb, you useless dimwit! And be quick about it – my arms are getting tired.”",
								"The figure dangling from the bridge is the hedge wizard Kopernikus. Holding him is Asiira (aspiring mercenary), an enforcer for the Black Blade. While her companions are attempting to bypass the hero’s tomb’s defenses, the female tiefling is scouting the surrounding area to make sure they are working undisturbed. She came across Kopernikus, who readily explained that he was heading to the hero’s tomb. She is now interrogating the wizard under duress, believing – errantly – that the wizard knows how to bypass the tomb’s riddles and defenses. For his part, Kopernikus is calmly explaining that he does not know anything, appearing quite unconcerned with the danger of his predicament.",

Tarquin instructs Nuyk to return to him once the characters have bypassed all the tomb’s defenses and reached the hero’s treasures.

								"If all goes well, the characters end up defeating the Black Blade and claiming the hero’s magic items. Depending on how they received the quest to go to the Hero’s Tomb, the adventure can end in various ways.",
								"The Black Blade",
								"If the characters manage to capture members of the Black Blade, they may be able to learn who sent them – perhaps Lord Protector Dagult Neverember, or another villainous character relevant to your campaign – unless you decide that the Black Blade is simply an opportunistic band of adventurers of dubious moral character, employed only by their own greed.",
								"Members of the Black Blade that manage to escape the tomb may also become recurring villains, showing up to accost the party later in the campaign, perhaps still looking for the hero’s treasures – or revenge!",
								"The Hero's Treasures",
								"Depending on who gave the characters their mission, they may feel obliged to return the magic items, or leave them at the hero’s tomb.",
								"If you want the characters to keep the treasure, you can have the hero’s disembodied voice speak to them while within the tomb: “My treasures are yours now. Keep them with you, use them for good, and – when your days of fighting evil are over – return them to me, so that other heroes like yourself can find them when it’s their turn to rise up.” Similarly, if the characters actually seem like decent, goodly heroes, a friendly character that hired the party to retrieve the items – such as Mirt of Waterdeep – can suggest that the characters hold on to them, and only return them when they no longer have use of them."

							"entries": [
								"Just like the book this adventure comes with – Adaptable NPCs of the Guild – this adventure is created to be highly adaptable, making it usable in virtually any campaign or setting. Below is advice on how to adapt the adventure to your campaign and your party’s level.",
								"{@b Adventure Background}",
								"The essence of the adventure’s background is simple: a hero has been laid to rest with their magic treasures, protected from thieves and tomb robbers by puzzles and traps. A band of nefarious tomb robbers are trying to steal the magic treasures but have so far been stymied by the tomb’s defenses.",
								"The most important thing to establish here is the identity of the hero since that will influence where the tomb is located and why the tomb robbers are trying to retrieve the hero’s treasures. Below are examples of suitable heroes you can use if the tomb is placed in the Forgotten Realms.",
								"{@b Lord Nasher Alagondar}",
								"Lord Nasher ruled Neverwinter until his death in the late 1300s. If you use Nasher, the tomb could be in the Neverwinter Wood and the murals in ‘T1. Entry Hall’ would show Lord Nasher adventuring with his party, The Northern Four, that time he slew a minotaur in battle, and the ruler embracing his son, Bann Alagondar.",
								"{@b Lord Dhelt}",
								"Lord Dhelt was Elturel’s High Rider and ruler until his death in the late 1300s. If using Lord Dhelt, the tomb could be in the Wood of Sharp Teeth, and the murals in ‘T1. Entry Hall’ would show Lord Dhelt on patrol with Elturel’s Hellriders, fighting off shadowy assassins in his bedchamber, and embracing his lover, the wizard Baranta Chansil.",
								"{@b King Gareth Dragonsbane}",
								"Gareth Dragonsbane was king of Damara until the late 1300s DR. If you use Gareth Dragonsbane, his tomb could be in Dunwood and the murals in ‘T1. Entry Hall’ would show King Gareth protecting the village of Bloodstone from an army of bandits, defeating the undead armies of the WitchKing Zhengyi, and holding hands with his wife Christine and son Murtil Dragonsbane.",
								"{@b Adaptable Adventure Hooks}",
								"Just like the adventure’s background, the hooks for the adventure given on pg.93 are also highly adaptable. Below are some ideas about how to fit the adventure into popular official fifth edition campaigns (beware, spoilers ahead!)",
								"{@b Baldur's Gate: Decent into Avernus}",
								"When speaking with Sylvira Savikas in Candlekeep, the wizard may urge the party to retrieve the items of Lord Dhelt, Elturel’s most revered ruler, from his tomb in the Wood of Sharp Teeth before their descent into Avernus. In this case, the Black Blade could be hired by High Overseer Thavius Kreeg shortly before his defeat at the hands of the heroes.",
								"They could also be simple opportunists capitalizing on the chaos that has gripped Elturgard since Elturel’s disappearance and left the tomb completely unguarded by patrolling Hellriders.",
								"{@b Lost Mine of Phandelver}",
								"At any point during the characters’ stay in Phandalin, Sister Garaele, the young elf acolyte who acts as caretaker for the Shrine of Tymora, informs the characters that her ‘friends’ (the Harpers) have seen rough-looking sorts camped out by Lord Nasher Alagondar’s tomb in the Neverwinter Wood. She asks the characters to go to the tomb and secure the items, lest they fall into the hands of wrongdoers.",
								"In this case, the tomb robbers could be hired by Dagult Neverember, who wants to use the items to cement his legitimacy as ruler of Neverwinter.",
								"{@b Storm King's Thunder}",
								"The threat of the rampaging giants – or the ancient dragon secretly behind it all – warrants the retrieval of the noble hero Piergeiron the Paladinson’s magic items from his tomb in Westwood.",
								"The characters can learn about the tomb from the giant wizard Zephyros (who can even fly the characters to the edge of the Westwood) at the end of Chapter 1. The quest for Piergeiron’s items can also replace quest hooks given by NPCs at the end of Chapter 2, such as Urgala Meltimer in Triboar, Duvessa Shane in Bryn Shander, or Zi Liang in Goldenfields. The characters may also receive the quest from the heroic frost giant Harshnag once they meet up with him during Chapter 3.",
								"In either case, you can have the Black Blade be sent by Iymrith, who wants to ensure that the magic items can’t be used to foil her evil plans.",
								"{@b Waterdeep: Dragon Heist}",
								"At any point during Chapter 2 or even at the end of the campaign, a friendly faction tasks the party with retrieving the arms and armor of Piergeiron the Paladinson in Westwood. The faction is acting on rumors that Lord Dagult Neverember – ousted Open Lord of Waterdeep – wants to spite Waterdeep by robbing their famed hero’s tomb.",
								"This faction quest works particularly well if given by Vajra Safahr (Gray Hands), Mirt (Harpers), Jalester Silvermane (Lord’s Alliance), or Savra Belabranta (Order of the Gauntlet).",
								"The characters’ reward is 1 renown with their faction, and the right to carry the items if they use them to aid Waterdeep and its citizens.",
								"{@b Adjusting the Difficulty}",
								"As written, the adventure will give a party of 2nd-level adventurers a tough challenge (especially one with fewer than five adventurers). If you feel the party may be overwhelmed by their final encounter with the Black Blade, consider removing the Janiel from the adventure entirely.",
								"{@b Adjusting to 3rd Level}",
								"For parties of four to six, you can increase difficulty by making the following changes:",
								"T2. Thief’s Room. The traps deal 3d8 damage.",
								"T4. Liar’s Room. The illusion deals 2d6 damage.",

								"T4. Liar’s Room. The illusion deals 2d6 damage.",

								"{@b Adjusting to 5th Level}",
								"For parties of four to six, you can increase difficulty by making the following changes:",
								"T2. Thief’s Room. The traps deal 4d8 damage and the DC for each saving throw increases to 14.",
								"T3. Foe’s Room. The knight’s statue is an dauntless champion, the witch’s statue is a red witch, and the undead’s statue is a half-dragon revenant.",
								"T4. Liar’s Room. The illusion deals 2d6 damage and the DC for discerning the illusion increases to 14.",
								"Black Blade. Asiira is an infernal warrior and Tarquin is a stormzerker.",
