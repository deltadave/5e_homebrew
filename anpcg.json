								"Amazing things happen when talented minds are brought together for a common goal, Adaptable NPCs of the Guild is proof of this! Following in the footsteps of the best selling #AdaptableNPCs line of products produced by the Grim Press, ANPCs of the Guild has surpassed all of our expectations. Tomasz Chistowski's art has been brought to life by over eighteen amazing authors from the DMs Guild, providing unique non-player characters to populate the world of Faerûn!",
								"Contained within this book are 63 unique non-player characters that can serve any number of roles in your player's adventures. Much like the others in its namesake, the ultimate goal of this supplement is to present a repertoire of quest givers and companions that can accompany players on their adventures; being diverse enough to add immersion without introducing unwanted complexity.",
								"Additionally, an engaging Pathway to Adventure called Hero's Quest has been included, written by the talented J.A. Valeur. This quest, designed for four to six characters of 2nd level, uses many of the Adaptable NPCs in this book and can be played upon detailed maps (both DM & Player versions) created specifically for this adventure! Also, the Hero's Quest is fully scalable for higher level play and includes custom quest hooks to drop this adventure into popular WotC campaigns such as Lost Mine of Phandelver, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Storm King's Thunder, and Baldur's Gate: Decent into Avernus."

								"Do your players seek the training of a seasoned armsmaster? Maybe they've been tasked with the need to seek out a retired Red Wizard of Thay to divulge information on one of the many secretive factions across Faerûn! Whatever the quest, the NPCs found within this supplement can serve many roles. With their mixed motivations and alignments, you can be certain that more than a few will be suitable for inclusion as plot drivers in any type of campaign a DM is planning to run. These NPCs can be used as traditional non-player characters by the dungeon masters or controlled by your players as mercenaries for hire. Alternatively, DMs may wish to run these NPCs as adventuring companions, accompanying your players for a short time.",

								"{@b Enlightened or Enraged}. The quest to confront their former allies typically culminates at a point where the abandoned knight must make a choice. Will they become consumed by anger and lash out at those who left them behind? Or maybe their time alone has allowed them to reflect, realizing that everything happens for a reason even though it was not have been immediately evident.

								"Born out of the deceitful union between a fiend and a human, much in the same way as their cambion siblings, agarions retain more of their human parent's appearance. Although their skin has an ashen coloring, missing are the horns, wings, and tails that their kinfolk brandish so proudly. The lack of these features allows agarions to inconspicuously assimilate themselves into many populations throughout the multiverse.",

Deceiving the gullible and twisting the ideals of the noble are favorite pastimes of the agarion, but don't let their enjoyment of these tasks fool you... Agarions rarely act without the underlying motivation of self benefit.",

As with their cambion siblings, it is common knowledge that Graz'zt's fervor for procreation with humanoids has led to the demon lord siring many agarions and cambions alike; those who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. However, unlike the cambions that are viewed primarily as soldiers and henchmen, agarions bread by the Dark Prince's act as infiltrators and assassins. Seeking out high-profile targets and decerning valuable information, or when the time requires it, assassinating those who might oppose their obsidian-skinned begetter.",

								"The armaster has seen more than their fair share of combat, and now most if not all their former companions have passed on. The armsmaster has no patience for those who view war and combat as glorious and will swiftly rebuke those who view war for any less than it is: hell. Their demeanour is gruff and impatient, speaking in barking tones that only the foolish would not heed. But those who listen to the armsmaster may find their skill in battle allows them to breathe for yet another day.",

								"{@b Master Tactician}. In the heat of combat and in the absence of a skilled commander, the armsmaster serves as leader to those around them. The calming presence bolters nearby allies and lends strength to their arms.",
								"{@b Weapons Training}. The armsmaster, having spent countless years mastering use of different weapons, is capable of bestowing even the most inept of adventurers with a fraction of his ability. Through an intensive training regime combined with repetitive exercises and drills, the armsmaster may train a willing and able student in the use of a fighting style of their choice.

								"Large cities are often filled with aspiring mercenaries, hoping to find mentors or take on low level contracts. The contracts that they do get are often close to meaningless; they rarely do more than settle petty squabbles or collect money for low level thugs. Aspiring mercenaries may be hired by adventurers as bodyguards or hired to follow them and thwart their plans. Due to the competitive nature of their work, aspiring mercenaries rarely work together or form alliances – the world of contract work is every person for themselves.",

								"Autumn is a time of transition between the lively growth of summer and the freezing decay of the coming winter. While many people take this time to celebrate the success of a fruitful harvest and to enjoy the company of neighbors before the isolating frosts set in, autumn shepherds thrive in the transition itself, finding power in the balance of nature. They find faith in the transitory nature of all things, rather than in any specific deity, and in doing so can learn to wield powers similar to the most devoted of clerics without ever dedicating themselves to a higher power. Believing it is their duty to draw upon these talents to shepherd others through transitions in life, they are as much at home by a death bed as is in a birthing room, though often welcome in neither.",
								"The autumn shepherd is illusive. Having made peace with both life and death as mere inevitabilities, they rarely feel the need for companionship, preferring instead to connect to the wilderness and its ever-changing seasons. Some rumor that their mastery over the flow of time allows them to move from one autumn to the next without so much as existing during the seasons in between.",
								"When they do have reason to interact with others, autumn shepherds prove to be unnervingly insightful. Their solitude and connections to both life and death make them eccentric.",
								"At the same time, an increased lifespan has given them substantial insight into how other people think. The combined effect is that they are capable of making themselves unnervingly terrifying or incredibly comforting to complete strangers with only a few words.",
								"{@b Unwelcome Presence}. Having made peace with death, the autumn shepherd has no qualms about hastening the demise of those who they believe cannot or should not be saved. This tendency makes them unwelcome in most settlements despite their incredible healing abilities, and it is not uncommon for locals to place a bounty on an autumn shepherd's head should they discover one resides in their area. Further complicating the situation, the autumn shepherd's insight into people's nature gives her uncanny ability to sway crowds, making her presence in populated areas a potential threat to those in power, most of whom are more than happy to vilify them for their association with death. As a result, the autumn shepherd generally avoids other people, choosing instead to live as a hermit in places where nature mirrors the transitional state to which they have devoted themself.",
								"{@b Living in Flux}. The autumn shepherd's most impressive abilities derive from their connection to the very essence of transition. Through incredible training and focus, they have learned not only to make peace with the transitional state of life, but also to bend that transition to their will. If they desire, an autumn shepherd can cause a person's age to advance or regress significantly. Through this talent they are also capable of extending their own life substantially, and some rumor that they can live indefinitely unless violently killed.",
								"Their ability to bestow youth is perhaps the primary reason people choose to seek them out. However, such quests are risky undertakings. There are few autumn shepherds deems worthy of additional years, and many hapless adventurers have believed themselves about to receive such a boon only to find themselves further aged by the autumn shepherd's magic instead.",

However, when they are supplanted by a lesser being, they are less accepting of this behavior. Among celestials, these, usually young, hero worshipers are most commonly known as avenging angels, reflecting their tendency toward revering one among their kind who has been wronged for being right.",
								"In the case of the avenging angel, the object of that worship has changed over the millennia, but since at least 1354 DR it has been, without exception, Zariel – their common name thus shortened to Zariel avenger.",
								"As with their predecessors, Zariel avengers have adopted a romanticized version of Zariel in their words, deeds, and persona. They express their disdain for the celestials who shrink back, while they press the battle against evil forward to where it dwells. While it is unlikely that one would go so far as self-mutilation, it is not uncommon for one to prosthetically adorn their left arm with a vicious weapon. It is rare, but one might shave their head. There are limits to the degree they will go, though, celestials have fantastic hair.",
								"{@b Not so Good}. In the hubris of their relative youth and immortality, they frequently exceed the limits of their wisdom and succumb to temptation and pride. Thus, veiled in the fog of war, Zariel avengers often struggle with their own degree of fallenness, ranging from simple verbal defiance to formalizing evil contracts similar to Zariel’s.",
								"{@b Frontline Fighters}. Zariel avengers gravitate to the frontlines in the battle against evil, where devils court humanoids and where demons erupt from the abyss.",
								"However, given their skill for invisibility and knack for appearing humanoid, they are not easily detected. In recent years, Baldur’s Gate has attracted a large number of attractive foreigners who ask a lot of questions and a greater number of treasure-seekers and adventurers who were last seen in one’s company.",

Each creature of its choosing that can hear the baelnorn (though it does not need understand it) must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or vanish from its current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane. The creature remains on this plane until the end of its next turn, at which point it returns to an unoccupied space of the baelnorn's choosing that it can see within 10 feet of the space that the creature vanished from.",

								"The forests teem with tiny beasts that are usually ignored by travelers and adventurers - swarms of ants, bees, wasps, and other insects. Even the keepers of the forests, such as rangers and druids, rarely take much notice of these critters.",
								"The bee keeper, of course, is different. This hermit has found among the insect swarms of the wilderness what they could not find in humanoid society - a sense of community and wholeness. The bee keeper protects the interests of these often ignored creatures, for they have no other protectors and yet perform fundamentally important duties within the ecosystems of the forest.",
								"{@b Cranky Hermit}. Even among those who live in the woods and prefer to be apart from civilization, the bee keeper stands apart. The bee keeper does not appreciate the druids, rangers and other wanderers in the forest who disdain the tiniest creatures that keep this ecosystem functional. The bee keeper is thus usually less than inclined to interact with other humanoids, often not speaking a word in months or even years.",
								"{@b Swarm Mentality}. The bee keeper sees themselves as part of the swarms they tend. They do not have a strong sense of self and will sacrifice themselves for their swarms if that is the best option to ensure their continued well-being. This mental shift permeates their whole behavior, often referring to themselves in the third person.",
								"{@b Friend of Swarms}. While swarms of beasts are often regarded as dangerous and possibly bound together to act as one by a malicious influence, the bee keeper is on good terms with them. The bee keeper interacts with swarms as easily as other keepers of the wild interact with individual beasts. The bee keeper even attracts swarms of bees and wasps that would not otherwise congregate.",
								"{@b Protector of Swarms}. This strange mutual attraction between the bee keeper and their swarms may be perceived as sinister by some, but the bee keeper does not harbor any ill intent towards others - so long as they leave the swarms of the forest alone. The bee keeper is particularly hostile to anyone who attempts to steal honey from the hives under their protection, cut wood in a part of the forest where ants have made their hills, or root out a nest of giant wasps bothering nearby settlements. The bee keeper considers the activities of the swarms at least as legitimate as the interests of humanoids - and far more worthy of protection, considering the low priority other protectors of the wild favor them with.",
								"{@b Insect Spies}. An ant crawls over an adventurer's boot, a bee buzzes around their head - tiny swarm insects usually go completely unnoticed by the unsuspecting traveler. The bee keeper takes advantage of this by regularly communing with the swarm insects in their domain to learn who passes through the forest. If the bee keeper grows suspicious of anyone, they send out spies specifically to track the potential intruder. Larger groups of travelers, especially when wellarmed or obviously proficient in magic, and travelers from foreign lands particularly arouse the bee keeper's suspicion.",
								"{@b Speak with Bees}. The bee keeper can communicate with bees, wasps, and other Tiny swarm insects as if affecting them with a speak with animals spell.",

								"Bladesingers are students of a uniquely elven fighting style, a masterful melding of arcane magic and martial swordplay.",
								"The training they go through is grueling and requires dedication of countless years even by elven standards. The style of a Bladesinger is defensive, they are the last to strike until the perfect opening presents itself. They will dance around near endlessly, letting their opponent grow sloppy, and strike with deadly efficiency.",
								"The nature of their arcane abilities often reflect their martial abilities, prioritising spells that keeps them agile, allows them to close the distance, and ultimately end the fight. All Bladesingers wish to be in the heat of melee conflict, that is where they can flourish and thrive. That is not to say that they cannot work from afar, the toying dance of an archer and a Bladesinger is a sight to behold. With each arrow dodged by the narrowest of margins, as the distance between the two closes, the panic that grows within the archer and the unsettling calm that remains in the Bladeslinger.",
								"Bladesingers come equipped with long slender blades, sometimes in pairs, sometimes those swords are crescent shaped, all depending on their individual tastes. They rarely wear thick suits of armor, opting for reinforced chainmail, or studded leathers to keep them as agile as possible. Most complete their outfit with richly dyed tabards or cloaks, fabrics that twirl and catch the wind as they battle.",
								"Most Bladesingers travel alone, they are solitary defenders of elven domains and go where they are needed. It is rare that any conflict requires more than one Bladesinger, but it is not unheard of.",
								"{@b The Bladesong}. The naming of bladesong stems simply from the combination of a flurry of blade whirls and the arcane chanting of the wielder. The bladesong is both as enchanting as it is dangerous. Most encounters with a Bladesinger begin slow, an occasional clash of blades and elegant dodge. However, as tempers of their opponents grow, as does the tempo of the blades, until there is a final crescendo and the Bladesinger stands victorious.",
								"Some Bladesingers lean heavily into the concept of a Bladesong, openly singing louder than the sounds of battle. It is their war-cry and to those who know, can be just as haunting as they sing with perfect clarity and calm, despite the cleaving wounds they’ve just dealt.",
								"{@b Dancers of Battle}. For anyone who has the privilege of watching a Bladesinger fight it is more akin to a dance than a battle. The Bladesinger is the choreographer and their opponent an unwilling partner, and yet the battle feels meticulously rehearsed. Occasionally, the Bladesigner cuts tauntingly, deep enough to feel, but shallow enough so that the fight may continue.",
								"Most Bladesingers are adept enough to take on three average opponents at once, deftly moving to keep each one scrambling and enraged. Others are said to be able to handle upwards of a dozen enemies, which can all be due to clever use of their surroundings, and a fair share of disorganisation on their opponent’s end. Bladesingers travel alone, meaning they often are outnumbered but very rarely outmatched.",
								"{@b Training in War and Song}. From a young age, bladesingers are taught how to cast their arcane magic while wearing light armor and using martial weapons. More impressive is the performance they put on while doing so.",
