								"Amazing things happen when talented minds are brought together for a common goal, Adaptable NPCs of the Guild is proof of this! Following in the footsteps of the best selling #AdaptableNPCs line of products produced by the Grim Press, ANPCs of the Guild has surpassed all of our expectations. Tomasz Chistowski's art has been brought to life by over eighteen amazing authors from the DMs Guild, providing unique non-player characters to populate the world of Faerûn!",
								"Contained within this book are 63 unique non-player characters that can serve any number of roles in your player's adventures. Much like the others in its namesake, the ultimate goal of this supplement is to present a repertoire of quest givers and companions that can accompany players on their adventures; being diverse enough to add immersion without introducing unwanted complexity.",
								"Additionally, an engaging Pathway to Adventure called Hero's Quest has been included, written by the talented J.A. Valeur. This quest, designed for four to six characters of 2nd level, uses many of the Adaptable NPCs in this book and can be played upon detailed maps (both DM & Player versions) created specifically for this adventure! Also, the Hero's Quest is fully scalable for higher level play and includes custom quest hooks to drop this adventure into popular WotC campaigns such as Lost Mine of Phandelver, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Storm King's Thunder, and Baldur's Gate: Decent into Avernus."

								"Do your players seek the training of a seasoned armsmaster? Maybe they've been tasked with the need to seek out a retired Red Wizard of Thay to divulge information on one of the many secretive factions across Faerûn! Whatever the quest, the NPCs found within this supplement can serve many roles. With their mixed motivations and alignments, you can be certain that more than a few will be suitable for inclusion as plot drivers in any type of campaign a DM is planning to run. These NPCs can be used as traditional non-player characters by the dungeon masters or controlled by your players as mercenaries for hire. Alternatively, DMs may wish to run these NPCs as adventuring companions, accompanying your players for a short time.",

								"Sitting near a shoddily made campfire, jilted thoughts of former friends weigh heavily on the abandoned knight's mind.",
								"Having been discarded seemingly on a whim by those considered allies or as part of a calculated plan by former associates, the reason matters little. The abandoned knight contemplates the apparently unanswerable question and becomes obsessed with reason they were betrayed.",
								"Slow to Trust. Having been tossed aside like a rusty broken sword, no longer of any use, abandoned knights understandably have strong feelings of distrust towards anyone who might reach out to them for companionship.",
								"Enlightened or Enraged. The quest to confront their former allies typically culminates at a point where the abandoned knight must make a choice. Will they become consumed by anger and lash out at those who left them behind? Or maybe their time alone has allowed them to reflect, realizing that everything happens for a reason even though it was not have been immediately evident. Perhaps the path chosen will be influenced by the strangers encountered during the abandoned knight's time of sorrow...",
