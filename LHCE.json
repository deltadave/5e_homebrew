								"There are many terrible fables told to sailors when at sea. Most are nothing but tall tales, fabricated by malicious captains to keep their motley crews in line. Those with a shred of truth once began believable, but have since became more fantastical with each retelling. Others, however, are very real. Tales of ancient titans who dwell beneath the crashing waves of the sea, and monstrous creatures of legendary repute that, to this day, still remain a deadly threat to all who brave the terrors of the briny deep."

							"entries": [
								"Legendary hunts are short monster hunting adventures a Dungeon Master can use to populate their Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. Each hunt focuses on a particular creature of legend, from the mighty and colossal deep dweller, to the strange and twisted bathyal beholder. Many of these creatures may exist at the same time, and overcoming each one can grant rare and powerful items. The fanged teeth of the deep dweller, for example, can be harvested and transformed into fearsome weapons, while segments of the bathyal beholder's shell can be turned into armor with unique magical properties.",
								"Each legendary hunt has a number of stages characters must go through before encountering the creature itself. Some legendary creatures, for example, require the characters to sail to a particular location and speak a mysterious shanty in order to summon it. Others might only appear on certain days, or must be lured out with an item or body part from a particular creature. Once summoned, a legendary creature fights with a monstrous ferocity and intelligence that can challenge even the bravest of characters."

							"entries": [
								"Many of the legendary creatures in this book have been written as unique monsters. Some are balanced to be fought against by a ship and crew on the high seas, while others are designed for smaller adventuring parties of varying level. Each hunt is divided into its own chapter, presenting a full color image of the legendary creature, lore, tall tales, and particular habits it is said to have, before outlining the regional and local effects the appearance of such a creature brings with it. Each chapter ends with a short quest involving the monster, various plot hooks to introduce it to your D&D games, a harvest table, and items a player can craft from harvested parts.  This supplement also assumes you have access to, or basic knowledge of the Monster Manual, Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Ghosts of Saltmarsh. Sometimes a quest in this book refers to one of the above supplements. These references are abbreviated as follows:",
								"Monster Manual: (MM)",
								"Player's Handbook: (PHB)",
								"Dungeon Master's Guide: (DMG)",
								"Ghosts of Saltmarsh: (GoS)",
								"If you see a creature's name in bold, that is an indication its stat block can be found in the Monster Manual, unless specified otherwise.  While these creatures have been designed as unique encounters for nautical and coastal adventures, this doesn't mean you can't tweak their origins or lore to fit in a different setting. The bathyal beholder, for example, could be changed to be the head of a cult located in a mysterious swamp, or inserted as a random encounter characters might come across in an ancient dungeon."

							"name": "Harvesting Creature Parts",
							"entries": [
								"Each legendary hunt in this supplement lists certain body parts that may be harvested from the creature therein, be them suckers, teeth, mandibles, blood, flesh or anything else as noted in their chapter. If the idea of harvesting pieces of dead monsters and turning them into useful items is appropriate for your campaign, the harvesting table in each chapter will tell you what body parts may be harvested, how difficult they are to craft, and the resulting item it can be turned into.",
								"Below is an example of the tables you can find in this supplement, as well as a breakdown of what each column means.",
								"{@b DM's Note}: Magical items harvested from these creatures are intended to be rewards in their own right. However, should you feel your players deserve more monetary rewards or other items, you are welcome to modify this to suit your campaign.",
								"{@b Table Guide}:",
								"{@b Body Part}: The part of the body that is being harvested, and how many pieces may be obtained from a successful harvest attempt.",
								"{@b Harvest DC}: This details the ability check and DC required to successfully harvest the chosen part and any storage requirements the part has. Each body part may only be successfully harvested once, unless specified otherwise, after which the body part is destroyed. If a creature fails the harvesting check by 5 or more, the body part is also destroyed, and can't be harvested again.",
								"If harvesting a body part requires two or more checks, the checks can be performed by any creatures involved in the harvesting.  A ranger, for example, might decide to join in on the harvesting by making the required Wisdom (Survival) check, leaving the Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to the rogue. Other characters can take the Help action to grant the harvesting characters advantage on the aforementioned checks.",
								"{@b Items Available to Craft}: This column lists the item or items that may be crafted from harvested creature parts. You can only produce one of the listed items with each crafting attempt. The crafted item's properties are detailed at the end of the chapter.",
								"{@b Item Crafting Requirements}: This section details any requirements that must be met to turn the harvested body part into an item. Harvested pieces that note a storage requirement (such as a vial or barrel of salt) must be placed in their respective containers immediately after being harvested, and should remain in the container until used in crafting. A harvested piece degrades over time when not placed in its particular container or being used for crafting. Each piece can remain outside of a container for a maximum of 1d4 hours (ignoring crafting times) before succumbing to rot. A rotten piece can't be crafted. If an item is listed under two or more tools, proficiency in and access to both sets of tools are required, though these proficiencies can be shared over multiple characters. For example, one character could take part in the crafting and have proficiency in one set of tools, and another character could also take part in the crafting and provide the proficiency needed for the other set of tools.",
								"{@b Crafting DC}: The ability check and DC that must be met to successfully craft an item, and the time required to do so. If this check is failed by 5 or more, the harvested pieces used are destroyed in the crafting process.",
								"If crafting an item requires two or more checks, the checks can be performed by any creatures taking part in the crafting of the item. A barbarian, for example, might decide to make the required Strength (Athletics) check, leaving the Intelligence (Arcana) check to the wizard. Other characters can take the Help action to grant the crafting characters advantage on the aforementioned checks.",

								"The stat blocks in this supplement use a collection of icons known as Encounter Icons. These icons are designed to offer advice to Dungeon Masters on the creature's behavior or see what kind of abilities it might have at a glance.",
								"Some icons might contradict each other, but this is intentional.  Icons are noted on a stat block in order of importance, with the most important icon on the left and the least important on the right. For example, a dragon would have lair lurker first, followed by the archer icon, then the rusher icon. For a dragon, remaining in its lair is far more important than staying at range breathing fire, and setting fire to its enemies is more important than rushing in with tooth and claw.",
								"The icons are purely an advisory tool. If you feel a creature would act a particular way that goes against its original design, then feel free to modify its behavior to suit your encounter.",
								"{@b Encounter Icon Descriptions}",
								"Each icon represents a particular set of tactics which are detailed below. The icons are in alphabetical order.",
								"{@b The Tank}: A creature with this icon often has a lot of hit points or a high AC (sometimes both) and is able to take a beating, but not necessarily inflict much in return. These creatures are usually intended to be used as frontline fighters against melee-heavy enemies or act as protectors for spellcasters. A tank's primary tactic is to soak up incoming attacks and focus on a single target at a time, shrugging off most damage while slowly whittling away its target's hit points.",
								"{@b The Ambusher}: A creature with this icon usually has lower than average hit points but a higher than average AC and deals increased damage, especially when surprising a target. An ambusher is intended to be used stealthily, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. An ambusher's primary tactic is to pick off one target at a time, starting with the weakest looking creature first. It uses hit and run tactics to confuse its opponents and retreats if cornered or close to defeat.",
								"{@b The Afflicted}: A creature with this icon primarily uses diseases or condition effects such as paralysis or poison to debilitate their targets. An afflicted is intended to be used aggressively, and spreads its attacks out between multiple targets first. The afflicted prioritizes attacking those who are immune to its debilitating ailments, or those who have the ability to cure them, ensuring they are dead before turning its attention to other targets.",
								"{@b The Rusher}: A creature with this icon focuses their attacks on a single creature at a time and continues until it is dead. The rusher is intended to be a challenging foe, and usually has either a few heavy hitting attacks, or many smaller attacks it can use to continually pressure its target. A rusher often attacks relentlessly and fights to the death.",
								"{@b The Defender}: A creature with this icon usually has a lot of resistances and condition immunities. A defender is intended to act as the opposite to the rusher, spreading out its attacks between nearby enemies and usually sharing an icon with the tank, spellcaster or ranger.",
								"The defender's primary tactic is to be cautious and careful when attacking, only moving in for the kill when it has a clear sign of victory and falling back or hunkering down if outnumbered.",
								"{@b The Caster}: A creature with this icon is capable of casting spells or generating magical effects. A caster is intended to be played based on its other icons, but is likely to recognise other creatures with the caster icon more easily. The caster's primary tactic is to eliminate rival casters as early as possible to establish magical dominance on the battlefield.",
								"{@b The Lair Lurker}: A creature with this icon has access to a lair. A lair lurker is intended to be played based on the combination of other icons on its stat block. The lair lurker's primary tactic is to use minions or lair actions to debilitate its enemies, and given the choice, fights from within its lair.",
								"{@b The Lone Wolf}: A creature with this icon prefers to fight alone, and doesn't work well with other groups of creatures. The lone wolf is intended to be used as a boss monster, assassin, or other solitary creature. It's primary tactic depends on the other icons present on its stat block.",
								"{@b The Pack Hunter}: A creature with this icon prefers to fight in groups to surround and overwhelm its foes with coordinated attacks.  The larger the group, the more aggressive the attack. A pack hunter will usually have lower hit points or AC than other monsters to counter balance the intended numbers implied in their use. It is unusual to encounter one of these individually, though it might happen if they face weaker foes.",
								"{@b The Underling}: A creature with this icon normally has extremely low hit points, AC and damage output, and act as minions in a hierarchy. An underling is intended to be used as a buffer to protect more valuable targets, or serve as chaff characters can fight their way through with little difficulty. An underling's primary tactic is dictated by other icons on its stat block.",
								"{@b The Archer}: A creature with this icon might excel at long range combat or have high mobility and rely on hit-and-run tactics; they avoid lingering in melee range if they can avoid it. The archer is intended to be used at mid to long range, where it can pick off its foes with relative impunity. Its primary tactic is usually to avoid melee creatures and focus on ranged enemies first, making good use of cover.",
								"{@b Creature Rarity}",
								"The icons in this supplement sometimes show in different colors.",
								"These colors dictate how rare a creature is intended to be in the world. Conventionally, the rarer a creature is, the more powerful it is, and the more abilities it has at its disposal:",
								"{@b Black}: The creature is commonly found in the world and can be seen regularly in its natural habitat. It is nothing overly extraordinary, though some creatures may still be considered exotic by passing travellers.",
								"{@b Blue}: The creature is uncommon and might have unique features. Such a creature is much more difficult to locate in the wild and might require help from a hunter or tracker, or only live in very particular environments.",
								"{@b Red}: The creature is rarely seen, and often has more than one special feature or legendary actions.  It might use a lair. These creatures are not easy to find, even by skilled trackers, usually requiring magical assistance.",
								"{@b Orange}: The creature is regarded as a myth or legend, only ever spoken of in long forgotten stories and tall tales. The creature is often unique, either in name, existence or some other method and might have many special features and legendary actions. It is likely to use a lair.",
								"{@b Example Stat Block}",
								"An example of how these encounter icons are used is shown in the driftwood mimic stat block opposite. The driftwood mimic isn't often seen but can be found in the wild, so it's encounter icons are displayed in blue. Its primary tactic is to ambush its victims, so it features the ambusher icon first.  Additionally, a driftwood mimic usually hunts alone, lacking both the intelligence and desire to work alongside other creatures; thus, it has the lone wolf icon.",
								"{@b Ready The Cannons!}",
								"Encounter icons added to ship stat blocks act as an advisory for NPC crew and captains. If players are in charge of the ship, the encounter icons can be ignored in favour of their decisions.",
								"Additionally, several ships in this book use gunpowder cannons. If your setting doesn't include gunpowder, these cannons can instead be magical creations, powered by arcane runes or mystical enchantments, or you can simply replace them for ballista."

Known to many as the deep dweller, this vast, colossal creature lurks within the bowels of the material plane, using huge submerged Underdark tunnels to traverse the world.",

								"The deep dweller resides in the lowest regions of the world, surfacing once every 200 years in search of its rival of the seas, the monstrous kraken. Rarely do the two creatures ever meet, but this predatory migration causes catastrophic effects for any who dwell in its path whenever the deep dweller appears. Cyclones tear across the sea for miles in every direction, while cities and port towns become assailed with sudden flash floods and battered by vast lightning storms.  A foreboding silence precedes the arrival of the deep dweller. Fish and other marine life scatter as its grasping tendrils pry and creep towards the waters surface, while seawater becomes coated in a magical, inky blackness. Fishing galleons are dragged into the dark depths as the deep dwellers grasping tendrils rip vast holes in their hulls. When it attacks, everything nearby is drawn towards its maw in a sudden torrent of undersea currents.",
								"Coastal city walls are crushed under the deep dwellers massive bulk as it surfaces to prey on moored fishing trawlers, tearing apart ocean trading towns and silencing entire populations with sanity-consuming psychic screams.",
								"{@b Motivations}",
								"The deep dweller is a creature born of pure evil and malice, and seeks only to consume and destroy. It fears nothing, and only retreats from combat if all its tentacles have been severed, or its eyes have been punctured. The deep dweller is fiercely territorial, and it believes its territory to be the entire ocean, with its only competitor being the kraken. It knows the location of every water borne gargantuan creature or entity within a five-mile radius, and pursues each of them relentlessly.",
								"Should the deep dweller ever face a kraken and emerge victorious, it drags the corpse down into the depths of the ocean, and doesn't return to the surface again for 500 years.",
								"{@b Adults and Juveniles}",
								"Only one deep dweller is thought to exist at a time, and its growth takes hundreds of years. A juvenile deep dweller, while not as strong as its adult counterpart, is still more than a match for a conventional sailing ship or party of unprepared adventurers. Juvenile deep dwellers follow a similar hunting pattern to their adult counterparts, and still exhibit many similar features, including any lair and regional effects its adult version is capable of creating. The items a character can craft from a deep dweller varies depending on its current age.",
								"{@b A Deep Dweller's Lair}",
								"The deep dweller resides in the darkest depths of the ocean, where light can't reach. When it surfaces, it brings a magical darkness with it, which serves as a mobile lair. This moving lair is beneath the waves, but generates a powerful lightning storm wherever it resides, which covers the surface of the water above the lair itself. Magical darkness fills the area of the lair underneath the water, and movement within it is considered difficult terrain for any creature that doesn't have a swimming speed.",
								"Creatures and ships caught in the storm above the lair have their maximum speed reduced by 10 feet, and visibility is reduced to a maximum of 120 feet regardless of vision, due to the lashing rain and natural darkness of the storm clouds. The storm can't be dispelled while the lair exists.",
								"The lair covers a 500-foot radius, centered on the deep dweller.",
								"Whenever the deep dweller moves, the lair also moves with it.  When the deep dweller is defeated or vanishes, the lair also vanishes, and the lightning storm dissipates in 1d4 hours.",
								"The deep dweller surfaces once every 200 years. It remains surfaced for 7 days. At the end of the 7th day it dives back down into the depths of the ocean and falls into a deep slumber, which lasts for 175 years.",
								"{@b Lair Actions}",
								"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the deep dweller takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:",
								"A sudden surge of water pulses out from the centre of the deep dweller's lair. Each creature or ship in the waters within 120 feet of the deep dweller must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from it. Ships that fail this saving throw are also turned to face a random direction, as per the table below. On a successful save, creatures and ships are pushed 10 feet away from the deep dweller instead, and ships retain their current facing.",
								"Lightning bolts strike down from the surrounding storm. The lightning bolts strike up to 3 targets within the storm that aren't completely submerged underwater. Each target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 10 (3d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.",

Its migration leads it many times through the Material Plane, where it preys on whales, giant squid, and even juvenile deep dwellers, should the legendary beasts ever cross paths.",
								"The abyss maw's extreme metabolism forces it to eat constantly throughout its lifespan. Each creature consumed is digested entirely, leaving no traces behind. This pattern has made hunting down the abyss maw an extremely tricky and costly endeavour. Many ships who set sail in search of it vanish overnight, their crews and supplies providing a brief, but grisly, nourishment for its unending search for food.",
								"{@b Territorial and Unrelenting}",
								"Although the abyss maw doesn't remain in the same location for very long, when it first arrives in a region it quickly rises to become a territorial alpha predator, contested only by the largest and fiercest of foes. The abyss maw doesn't back down if challenged over territory by a more powerful creature, opting instead to cause as much damage to its opponent as possible before its own demise. Like a cornered rat, the abyss maw fights with tooth and tendril until either it or its attacker are slain. Even after its death, the damage its opponent sustains from such an unrelenting assault can leave lasting, permanent scars. Some larger monstrosities, such as the astral dreadnought, can be seen sporting a plethora of scarred wounds from such pyrrhic victories, acting both as a trophy of survival and as a warning to others.",
								"{@b Motivations}",
								"An abyss maw exists as a toxic infestation, invading the territories of other species with the sole purpose of driving them out of their natural habitats. The abyss maw traverses the planes on the currents of the Astral Sea, becoming drawn to the Material Plane when spellcasters call upon particularly potent divination magic, like a moth drawn to an open flame. Once manifested, the abyss maw explodes with rage and hunger, attacking everything in sight until it consumes its way to the top of the food chain.",
								"{@b The Abyss Maw's Lair}",
								"The abyss maw's lair is located in a dark cove, cave or underwater lake, most commonly found in the upper levels of the Underdark. The lair is always half-filled with water, creating a pool connected together by a series of underwater tunnels. The abyss maw uses these tunnels to travel from one area of the lair to the other. The lair is connected to the outside world by means of a large flooded tunnel, carved out by the abyss maw itself. This tunnel stretches for anywhere between 1 and 3 miles, and appears naturally formed to the untrained eye. Tooth marks etched into the rock hint at its unnatural creation.",
								"The tunnel has its own ecosystem, filled with alien fish and aquatic life originating from various planes of existence, drawn to the lair by the abyss maw's planar magic. The lair itself is a bridge between two or more planes, and exhibits traits common to them. If the lair were linked between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire, it might exhibit extreme heat and be situated near an active volcano.",
								"Fire elementals would drift atop pockets of bubbling water, while firenewts form small colonies on rocky outcrops. If the abyss maw were to migrate to the Shadowfell next, the lair would be devoid of color, and endemic life, such as the aforementioned firenewt colonies, would appear grey and skeletal.",
								"The abyss maw remains in its lair between 10 and 15 hours per day.",

While its truesight is doubled in this way, it is able to innately detect if any creature within that radius is not native to the Plane of Existence they are on. If the abyss maw detects such a creature, it may use its reaction to immediately cast banishment using its Innate Spellcasting feature, doubling the range of the spell to 120 feet.",
								"A surge of planar magic permeates the lair, creating disruptive feedback to spellcasters within it. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a spellcaster attempts to cast a spell, they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 force damage per level of the spell (minimum 1d6), and the spell fails. Druid and Ranger spells are immune to this effect.",
								"Powerful magical winds rush through the lair from a random Plane of Existence, causing a brief, but potent, atmospheric shift. Each creature of the abyss maw's choosing must make a saving throw from the Planar Winds Table. If the effect deals damage, it deals the amount shown in the table on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

								"\"The creature can't be tied down or chained. We tried everything short of magical restraints. It was simply not good enough.\"",
								"\"Its grasping pseudopods protrude from a singular flesh sac, located within it's throat. While the flesh sac appears to be extremely resilient, the pseudopods can be severed with surprising ease.\"",
								"\"Each pseudopod acts as a conduit for, granting the creature magical abilities far beyond that of a conventional wizard. It is unclear whether the removal of these pseudopods should impact the creature's casting ability or not.\"",
								"\"The creature is not restricted to breathing water. Eyewitness accounts claim the creature had no difficulty fighting atop their galleon.\"",
								"\"Eyewitnesses report the creature to be extremely large in size; both resilient enough in resistance and size to present a challenge to even the most experienced crew.\"",
								"{@b Consult The Gods} ({@b DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check}). The character attempts to commune with their chosen deity or patron, gleaming fragmented imagery of the abyss maw they can interpret. On a successful check, read or paraphrase one of the following visions to the character:",
								"\"You stand in a cold, black lake, your feet barely dipping beneath the water's icy surface. Six glowing tendrils snake out of the darkness towards you, shifting and blinking in and out of existence before the water gives way beneath you; plunging you towards a colossal, multi-toothed maw.\"",
								"\"Your skin prickles as you feel your astral form drift upwards, slowly being drawn towards the Astral Sea. You see shapeless forms writhe and twist in the void. Suddenly, they take shape, as a vast, schooner-sized creature breaches the wistful peace. Its multiple eyes dart in various directions as its gigantic tendrils propel it through the Astral Sea, before it flickers, and vanishes from sight.\"",

								"Peck explains the location must contain a large body of water, otherwise the abyss maw could be drawn elsewhere by mistake. They ask the characters to help him ambush and kill a Giant Octopus lurking in the waters. Once defeated, Peck performs the summoning ritual outlined earlier in this chapter, using the giant octopus as a component. The characters must then sing the abyss maw sea shanty to completion in order to draw the abyss maw into the location. Peck sings the lines written in bold. The characters should sing the crew lines, written in italics.",

Should intruders break into the bathyal's underwater fortress, the beholder floods the ground with seawater before rising up to higher levels to harry its foes from above.

A creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn't knocked prone on a successful one. If a creature fails this saving throw by 5 or more, it is also buried under the beholder's treasure, and is restrained. A restrained creature can drag itself free of the mounting treasures by using its action to make a {@b DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check}.",

A tyrant is a master of its innate abilities and surroundings, capable of manifesting much more powerful spells than its younger counterparts. Some bathyal tyrants even choose to enter melee of their own accord, their spined tendrils and muscular form more than a match for most conventional opponents. These tyrants, while much more dangerous, are also more sought out by hunters for their blood, which transforms to a deep green upon a bathyal's growth into a tyrant. A tyrant's blood has much higher value on the black market than it's lesser kin.",

								"Experimenting in a hidden laboratory to create a weapon resistant to the aboleths' psionic powers, Razi secretly developed hybrid creatures, combining aboleth organs with cyclopean volunteers through complex rituals that blurred the lines between wizardry and science. They hoped that their creations could be controlled and turned against the aboleths, but their efforts met with failure.",

Positioning themselves and their followers along the edge of the circle, Razi spoke words from before the time of gods and unleashed untamed ancient magic into the laboratory.

The greenjacket is immune to the diseases it carries, developing antitoxins as quickly as the evolving bacteria which courses through its internal organs.",

Killing a greenjacket can be just as dangerous as leaving one alive, because the creature's blood contains pheromones which draw smaller swarms of its kind to the place of its death.

When sailors pull up nets of fish and aquatic life, parasights are often dredged aboard, though any fishermen worth their salt knows to quickly stamp the creatures out before they have a chance to bury themselves in a new host.",
								"{@b Parasitic Lifeforms}. The parasight earned its name due to its unique and terrifying parasitic nature. In order to feed and reproduce, the parasight clamps down on the area around a sleeping creature's eye socket, injecting it with a numbing toxin before consuming the eye and burrowing into its skull.",
								"{@b Deviant Deceivers}. When the parasight claims a host, it entrenches itself in the creature's nervous system, hiding in plain sight by replacing the consumed eye with its own. The replacement eye grants the host creature an adaptive darkvision and increased perception, fooling the host into believing its senses have begun harmlessly sharpening of their own accord. Over time, the parasight slowly influences the hosts decisions and personality as it consumes and replaces its brain.",
								"{@b Grisly Killers}. The parasights primary goal is to reproduce and feed.",
								"Once the parasight consumes and replaces the brain of its host, it can only survive for a few days before succumbing to starvation.",
								"During this last stage of its life, the parasight produces a small cluster of eggs from the tendrils protruding from its rear. The eggs cling to the host's hollow skull, and quickly mature into newborn parasights which burst forth and scatter from the host via its ears, eyes, nose or mouth once the parent parasight dies.",
								"{@b Detection and Prevention}. Sailors and fisherman have developed a system of detection for the ghastly parasight, though due to its Intelligence and adaptability, the system is rarely full proof. A parasight infection is usually revealed by the host's eye color changing at random intervals during the day. Other symptoms include an enhanced vision and less blinking than usual. During the later stages of infection when the parasight takes full control, a tendency to smile at everything, consume copious amounts of food, or speaking in a simplistic way tone reveals its presence. By this time it is too late to save the host, but swift action can prevent anyone else from becoming the next victims.",
								"A parasight, once detected, can be removed by impaling the replacement eye and forcibly pulling the creature out from inside the host's head. Alternatively, the parasight can be forced out of its host by increasing or decreasing the host's body temperature for extended periods of time.",
