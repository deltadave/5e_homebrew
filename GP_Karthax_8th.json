								"An ancient primordial creature whose vast memory extends prior to the coming of the gods, prior to the Great Cataclysm, and even to another Plane of existence, Acythylass the Ancient is a creature of great knowledge and wisdom that once lived...elsewhere.",
								"Prior to coming to this world, Acythylass was part of a civilization that enslaved countless beings and consumed the minds of countless more. Seeing the deepest fears and fondest wishes of those they consumed only made Acythylass thirst for more, and as such, the creature developed a reputation for being the most cruel and ruthless of their kind.",
								"All was well in Acythylass' cruel and blood-soaked world — until the true gods arrived and destroyed all that their civilization had built. The survivors of the once-glorious empire scattered, among them Acythylass, who fled deeper and deeper into the Abyss.",
								"By sheer happenstance, Acythylass came upon an underwater portal to a different realm. Fearing for their life at the hands of those that others would deem the true gods, Acythylass fled within the portal, emerging into a new world, one whose depths were filled with all manner of creatures yet untouched by the malevolent presence of the aboleths. Thus Acythylass had at last found the perfect refuge from which to reconstruct a new empire, one of their own imagination, which they could rule over without interference from those filthy self-proclaimed gods — or so they thought.",
								"While this new world was untouched and ripe for conquest; it was also wild and savage. Creatures of the depths unseen and unencountered by Acythylass, their ancestors, or those whose minds they consumed lurked in the great abyssal depths of this new world.",
								"Aiming to conquer and remold this new world in their own image, Acythylass quickly began to amass an unerringly loyal following. Over centuries, Acythylass, now known as the Ancient One to their subjects, began to construct a new and vast empire beneath the waves — that is, until the seas boiled with fury the likes Acythylass had never before encountered.",
								"Rockslides decimated the depths. Maelstroms consumed Acythylass' progeny. Tidal waves cast their followers ashore to perish in the dry overworld. Once again, Acythylass fled, seeking the safety of a vast underground cavern system that eventually led into the depths of a newly constructed tower.",
								"This tower was unlike any others, for using their vast telepathic powers, Acythylass was able to touch an element of the consciousness of a being of vast power, one who seemed of a similar essence to the so-called gods that had once overthrown Acythylass' former civilization. This essence identified itself as Karthax.",
								"Sensing an opportunity to both regain their former strength, Acythylass settled within the tower and began to engage in an unending battle of wits with Karthax. Acythylass spawned more progeny once again, summoned the pitiful remnants of their following, and began to learn what they could from the god. Acythylass could sense the time of the gods might soon be at an end..."

								"The final level of The Living Tower sees adventurers teleported to its foundation, which is so deep that it taps into an underground aquifer system beneath the wastelands upon which The Living Tower sits. Within dwells Acythylass the Ancient as well as Greylythoon, their identical but physically smaller progeny who has taken a new name. They, along with their servitors and cecaelia minions are the inhabitants of this floor, and are able to come and go as they please through these tunnels.",
								"Being immensely powerful while in their lair, we envision Achythylass and Greylythoon as initially merely observing the adventurer's actions at first, determining their threat or potential as servitors. Being both cruel and highly intelligent, they are likely to toy with their prey before dispatching it with a minimum of effort and consuming the minds of their victims.",
								"Having consumed the minds of countless other beings who eventually made their way to this floor, both Acythylass and Greylythoon have detailed knowledge of The Living Tower as well as each of its denizens. Whether they share that knowledge or even see fit to discuss it is of another matter.",
								"Both creatures are motivated by a single purpose, to reconstruct their great empire once more. To do so they require a workforce, and as such will be more inclined to enslave than to outright kill visitors to their lair.",
								"We have included several potential suggested dynamics to add an element of challenge to this floor:",

It makes several areas difficult to traverse, and may result in adventurers becoming separated from each other. If separated, it may provide an excellent opportunity for either Acythylass or Greylythoon to attack, subdue, or enslave loners.",
										"Acythylass may choose to project an illusion of themselves to goad or otherwise engage the adventurers, perhaps enticing them onward.",
										"The dynamic between Acythylass and Karthax might be an interesting one — being arrogant, Acythylass or Greylythoon may be inclined to monologue about their opposing views compared to Karthax — that is, enslavement and subjugation as opposed to free will.",
										"The mucus coating of Acythylass and Greylythoon, while causing a disease that prevents a creature from being out of water for a prolonged period of time, is also the means by which adventurers escape The Living Tower via another underground river that eventually flows to the sea (see the Epilogue section).",
										"Underwater combat may prove difficult for characters — yet defeating Acythylass and Greylythoon is not required to escape The Living Tower, for characters may still escape via the underwater cavern system beneath The Living Tower."

										"The ancient primordial creature known as Acythylass has lived for many millennia, in both this world and others. Despite their nearly impeccable memory, even such distant times are difficult to recollect, for few beings could possibly imagine the troves of knowledge lurking within their mind, never mind comprehending the meanings of such knowledge.",
										"For the sake of the pitiful mortal beings that call this world home, suffice to say that Acythylass the Ancient, was once a powerful overlord in another world. The Ancient and their brethren were responsible for the enslavement of countless beings, and as a cruel and merciless ruler directed the construction of a great underwater civilization that spanned the ocean. Their rule was absolute, until the true gods (or were they god-like beings?) arrived in their world. In their self-righteous ways these beings waged a great war against the primordials, eventually triumphing over the ancient ones and driving the few that remained into the depths.",
										"Seething in impotent rage, Acythylass fled along with the remnants of their once-glorious — and blood-soaked — civilization. The primordial beings, reduced to bickering amongst themselves and vying for supremacy, scattered across the seas. Alone, Acythylass came to an underwater maelstrom that proved to be an underwater portal to...elsewhere.",
										"Seeing an opportunity to flee this realm and perhaps build a new civilization, more glorious than the last, Acythylass entered the maelstrom, emerging into a sea teeming with an abundance of life the likes they had never before seen.",
										"The primordial set about their task with fervor, conquering the simple-minded underwater denizens of this world with ease, consuming the minds of those who would not bend to their will. Known to their subjects only as the Ancient One, they set about crafting a new underwater empire. More than that, armed with the knowledge of the existence of other worlds, perhaps linked by portals such as the one that brought them here, Acythylass began scheming to conquer not only the seas of this world, but of others as well.",
										"Over several centuries, Acythylass consolidated their power, bred formidable offspring containing the genetic memory of their hermaphroditic parent, and carved out an empire in the northern seas that surface dwellers feared to sail with their flimsy wooden vessels. Those who were bold, foolish, or plain stupid enough to try to traverse these waters quickly met a watery grave. Those who were strong enough to resist the Ancient One's minions were psionically dominated and kept as servitors who would obey their every whim.",
										"While the ongoing events of the surface world seldom concerned Acythylass, as they would later learn an event known as the Great Cataclysm boiled the seas and once again annihilated centuries of effort.",
										"Rockslides buried the newly constructed cities Acythylass' followers had toiled to build. Multiple maelstroms opened and consumed the Ancient One's progeny, their fate unknown. Tidal waves swept all but a pitiful few of Acythylass' followers onto the shore where they perished beneath a withering sun.",
										"Acythylass fled once again, seeking refuge within a complex underwater cavern system beneath the main continent of this world. There, safe from the ravages unleashed by the Great Cataclysm, Acythylass tentatively reached out with their psionic energies, touching the mind of a powerful being that seemed...familiar.",
										"Following this mind, Acythylass came to the foundation of a relatively newly constructed tower, perhaps only a few years old. The Ancient One, wary of the presence of a powerful so-called god, also saw opportunity, for it seemed the god-like presence that identified itself as Karthax was unfamiliar with the primordials.",
										"Likewise, Karthax saw an opportunity engaging with the primordial, for never had they encountered such a strange being whose mind was so foreign to that of the mortal denizens of this world.",
										"The two beings — Ancient One and Eld God — thus began slowly learning about one another, always probing, always debating, always seeking an advantage or secret knowledge the other might possess. Allowing this strange being from elsewhere access at will to the submerged cavern system beneath the wastelands and into The Living Tower suited Karthax well. Not only did the Eld God slowly begin to learn the ways of a being so unlike anything they encountered, but it also provided the Eld God with the opportunity to debate with a highly intelligent being. In exchange, Acythylass was provided with shelter and — unbenownst to Karthax — the opportunity to study, and perhaps even seek vengeance, against one of the self-proclaimed Gods that had ruined the Ancient One's rule so many millennia ago.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Acythylass.} Acythylass is cruel, cunning, and arrogant. However, they are also extremely intelligent and curious, and will engage with adventurers if only to determine if they are a threat. After toying with adventurers for a bit for their own amusement, Acythylass will inevitably grow bored and attempt to separate and enslave them.

										"A somewhat prickly and grumpy gnomish diviner, Fargrim Sunffbottom comes from a long line of gnomes renowned for their magical abilities — though his family is perhaps even better known for their unique brew of turnip ale. Standing a proud 3 feet 6 inches tall and weighing a healthy 3 stone (42 lbs), Fargrim is both proud and stubborn. Gnomish children in his village would frequently evade Fargrim whenever he would trundle down the streets and alleys with the support of his staff, ducking away from his glare - for he had a fearsome reputation for being impatient and ornery, particularly with children — for the old gnome had little time for shenanigans and pranks.",
										"Yet despite his outward hard exterior and gruffness, the bearded, white-haired old gnome cares deeply about his family, friends, and village — including the children, as well.",
										"While content to run the brewery that had been in his family for several generations, Fargrim would on occasion seek to glimpse into the future. On most occasions but a few fleeting images would come to the gnome; yet on one fateful night, perhaps notable for his testing of a new ale recipe perhaps a bit excessively, a vision as clear as the spring water used in his brews came to Fargrim.",
										"First, Fargrim beheld the sight of a teetering stone tower in a blasted wasteland. He beheld an image of a being of light, so bright and beautiful they nearly blinded him. Reaching out, the being released nine gemstones: four (a pearl, ruby, diamond, and onyx) burned brightly with an inner fire, levitating above the others. One, what appeared to be jade, barely levitated and only hinted at an inner light. Three (a sapphire, emerald, and topaz) remained in the being's hand, clasped tightly. The final gemstone — an ever-changing opal that reflected the being's light into countless colors, levitated apart from the others.",
										"Countless images then rapidly flashed before Fargrim's eyes: of legions of horned, cloven-footed creatures bearing vicious weapons, of great armies clashing. Of bound and chained beings of many races, marching along worn paths into the distance while carrion crows circled above.",
										 "Fargrim beheld images of great battles — of strife and conflict. Such visions brought the old gnome to his knees, before he saw the tower once more — illuminated by a ray of light that caused it to crumble and collapse. The last of the premonitions was a telepathic voice reaching out to him: \"The time is nigh. In the north, the fate of free will shall be decided.\"",
										 "Head throbbing, Fargrim awoke in a cold sweat from what he had beheld. Determined to prevent the calamities he had just witnessed from coming to pass, that very day the wizard set forth, trusty staff in hand and the adventurer's pack from his father upon his back.",
										 "For several months, Fargrim traveled north, always inquiring from the locals if they knew of a crumbling tower in a barren wasteland, yet most simply looked queerly at the gnome — clearly too old for adventuring — as though he was a lunatic. One local, however, told Fargrim of a new mining venture to the north, where gemstones of great value had been discovered. Perhaps there Fargrim might find the answers he sought?",
										 "With newfound hope and determination, Fargrim continued onward, his divinations burned into his memories.",
										 "Within one of the many taverns set up to quench the thirst of the newly wealthy miners, Fargrim came across a charming adventurer on the same path, who had also heard of the crumbling tower. The stranger accompanied Fargrim into the barrens, where they finally — exhausted, dusty, and with food and water depleted — came to the crumbling tower Fargrim beheld in his vision. Turning to thank his companion, Fargrim was shocked to find he had disappeared with nary a trace.",
										 "Entering the tower, Fargrim was immediately addressed by a telepathic voice: \"I have been waiting...welcome to my tower! Enter, and you may find the answers you seek...\"",
										 "Completely alone and armed with only his wits and skills as a wizard, Fargrim entered without hesitation.",
										 "His wiles have allowed the lone gnome to outwit many of the foes in The Living Tower — having escaped from Krul'Thunk, the three sisters, as well as Jarl Hjálmŷr before coming to this floor, which Fargrim is just beginning to explore.",
										 "{@b Roleplaying Fargrim Snuffbottom.} Fargrim Snuffbottom is an old, stubborn, and cantankerous gnome. While at first he may come across as argumentative, even offensive to some, Fargrim will listen carefully and, should a course of action make sense, relent and eventually help others out.

They are wary of outsiders, and may attack if they sense the slightest threat.",

Such treasure hoards are stored in underwater caves, and fiercely guarded by members of the colony. Trade is an unknown concept to the cecaelia, and despite having no apparent understanding of mathematics they know the identity and location of each individual piece of treasure they have salvaged. Some members of the colony may adorn themselves with trinkets, thought to reflect a higher social standing in the colony, or even bear daggers in their clawed appendages."

								"Below is the Karthax's Quips table: a d100 table containing phases, riddles, taunts, omens, and even possibly a few words of wisdom that can be used to help Karthax narrate while players are exploring The Living Tower. The intention with Karthax's Quips table is for Game Masters to roll on it and then read aloud the phrase indicated. While a quip might not be relevant to the floor the party is currently exploring, they have been created to be general enough so that they will foreshadow what is to come, or serve as a quick reminder of what was already experienced.",
								"The idea for this table is to add a dynamic nature to Karthax and make this omniscient being feel \"alive\", but not everything needs to be so serious. Some of the responses, narrated when the party is in a sticky situation, can be used to great comic effect. A GM might wish to read through the tables before running Karthax: The Living Tower; picking and choosing phrases in advance.",
								"The general outline of the d100 Karthax's Quips table is for each group of 10 quips to refer to their numbered floor. For example, taunts 11-19 refer to the 1st Floor, 20-29 refer to the 2nd Floor, and so-on. Taunts 01-09 are general, and refer to the tower itself, or are simply Karthax's general thoughts. The table has been organized in this manner so GMs can easily pick taunts for a current or upcoming floor if they wish. In addition to the d100 Karthax's Quips table, there are nine d6 Karthax's Tips tables, one for each floor of The Living Tower. These d6 tables are specific to their corresponding floor, and can be used while a party is exploring that particular floor.",

This can be as simple as having a unique accent for Karthax, or perhaps Karthax represents someone in your campaign that the players will recognize and is now embodied by the tower. Either way, being consistent in your delivery of Karthax's quips will let your players get onboard with the sarcastic nature and have a bit of fun conversing with Karthax as they explore The Living Tower.",
