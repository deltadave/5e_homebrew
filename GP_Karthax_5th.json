								"The generation prior to the eruption of hostilities that marked the beginning of the Great Cataclysm was largely one of enlightenment. By this time, many mortals had been educated in the ways of art, literature, and magic. Universities and libraries were home to countless learned beings of all races who gathered in peace to debate religion and philosophy. The mortal races, by and large, were at peace, unified within the knowledge that beings far greater than themselves clearly wanted the mortal races to flourish under their benevolent gaze.",
								"During this time, three sisters were born to a family of modest means. Despite their common upbringing, the trio were wildly different and yet tightly bound together in sisterhood that seemed unbreakable. Kyreen, the eldest, was disciplined, studious, and of even temperament. The youngest, Faradel, was impulsive, arrogant, and aggressive, and particularly competitive with her sisters. The middle sister, Avilnar, was aloof and disinterested in the ways of the world, yet a mischief-maker extraordinaire.",
								"From a young age, the three sisters showed a natural aptitude and draw toward the arcane, and thus were attended to by the finest tutors and scholars their parents could provide. They were educated in all areas of the arts — literature, poetry, theater, history, debate, and magic. Yet where their hearts truly lay was in philosophy and religion and the deep interconnection of these topics with the Eld Gods. The sisters spent countless hours debating their will.",
								"Faradel favored the argument that the weak should be ruled by the strong, and that law and order would naturally fall into place based on the strength of the prevailing chaos of nature. Kyreen agreed that the strong should prevail but the will of the Eld Gods superseded natural law; thus their Order must be obeyed at all times. Avilnar deeply enjoyed antagonizing the two opposing views, and her views often seemed (and were) fickle and chaotic.",
								"Seeing these three argue the finer points of the Great Debate caused several of the Nine Eld Gods to take great interest in them. The Eld Gods began to weave their influence over the minds of the three, subtly affecting their thoughts, for the Eld Gods sensed the three sisters could become valuable servants to spread their word to other mortals. Over time, the Eld Gods' influence poisoned their minds, twisting the sisters' lively debate into furious arguments, pitting them against each other.",
								"By the time the Great Cataclysm erupted, the three were so opposed that any bond of sisterhood had long disintegrated, and they joined their patrons to wage war upon each other.",
								"When the ashes settled and Order prevailed, Kyreen was tasked with hunting down Faradel and Avilnar, who in turn sought vengeance against each other. Faradel, injured in one encounter, entered The Living Tower in exchange for sanctuary, not knowing her sisters would enter in pursuit of each other. Known as the Sisters of the Cataclysm, they have been bound in an endless hunt for each other within The Living Tower."

								"While they perceive that only a few days have passed since they entered The Living Tower, Kyreen, Faradel, and Avilnar have in fact been pursuing each other on a single floor since they entered millennia ago. They have been engaged in an endless hunt for each other, each emerging victorious over another many times over the centuries. To maintain their burning hatred for one another, each time a victor emerges from their unending hunt Karthax wipes their memories, resurrects the fallen, and allows the hunt to begin once again. Karthax has also blocked their memories with respect to their patrons — when questioned about the Eld Gods they will pause, stare blankly for a moment, then proceed as though the question was never asked.",
								"All three possess information and lore about the Great Cataclysm, though none remember the specifics of the Eld Gods who were their patrons.",
								"Each of the sisters, if encountered, will engage with the visitors to this floor: Kyreen attempting to forcibly lead, Faradel offering a choice (aid her or die), and only Avilnar will allow the characters to make up their own minds without fear of retribution.",
								"Once the characters have aligned themselves with one of the three, as a GM, we recommend making an initiative and beginning the hunt for the other sisters — moving the other forces accordingly."

										"The eldest of the three sisters of the Cataclysm, Kyreen is disciplined and intelligent, yet rigid in thought and lacks flexibility to see other perspectives. While debating her sisters and later hunting them down, this proved both an advantage and a potential weakness, in that her single-minded determination made her a relentless foe in combat but left her vulnerable to the unpredictable tendencies of her sisters and their tactics.",
										"A particularly pious individual, Kyreen was in the midst of deeply examining the origins of the Eld Gods when war broke out and was convinced in the requirement for strict laws, predetermined in the Eld God's boundless wisdom, that would maintain justice for all mortal races and ensure peace. Kyreen thus also devoted herself to many hours of meditation and prayer, and through her piety has access to powerful magic to both aid others and bring divine justice to the forces of chaos.",
										"During the Great Cataclysm, her patron presented her with an enchanted warhammer that glows with radiant power whenever creatures of a chaotic nature are near, which assisted Kyreen in hunting down and exterminating countless foes during the Cataclysm.",
										"Clad in a heavy suit of plate, Kyreen made for a fearsome sight at the vanguard of several of the bloodiest battles of the Great Cataclysm and became revered as a leader by her allies and reviled by opposing forces.",
										"Lawful mortal warriors, priests, clerics, and paladins were drawn to Kyreen while the forces of Order were gathering. Her followers were blindly faithful and loyal to her, obeying Kyreen's every command regardless of impact to others.",
										"After the Great Cataclysm, Kyreen was tasked with hunting down and exterminating the remaining forces aligned with chaos and free will; thus she led an elite cadre of hunters to pursue these remnants and eventually her own sisters. Slowly, this force was whittled down to just her, the last of the sisters to enter The Living Tower — exchanging her presence within for the opportunity to at last confront her sisters.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Kyreen.} Her sisters would have described Kyreen as pious, elegant, single-minded, and inflexible before they came to hate one another. Now they would describe her as a self-righteous fool blinded by an outdated and altruistic concept of what the world should be as opposed to what it is. Kyreen speaks boldly and confidently and comes across as a competent and confident leader. She leads through strength, however she views leadership through force and does not tolerate subordinates or other beings questioning her thoughts, actions, and tactics.",
										"Kyreen is particularly suspicious of creatures of a chaotic alignment, and mistrusts them as she is unable to predict what actions such creatures might take.",
										"She may nonetheless ally with such beings, though only for so long as Kyreen can tolerate what she perceives as their self-centered motivations. Eventually, though, all must obey her commands and subject themselves to her.",
										"Kyreen can be articulated as follows:",
										{
											"type": "list",
											"items": [
												"- When describing how she entered The Living Tower:  \"{@i I was pursuing my vile sisters. They must be brought to justice for their crimes — order has prevailed!}\"",
												"- When describing Faradel (spitting on the floor):  \"{@i Pah! That vile creature knows not what is coming for her. She weaves her twisted magic creating abominations that threaten us all. She must be eliminated!}\"",
												"- When describing Avilnar:  \"{@i Oh my foolhardy little sister...she never was of sound mind. This left it to be twisted by whatever creature she served. The atrocities she has committed in their name must be avenged! She must be exterminated!}\"",
												"- When interacting with characters of a lawful alignment: *\"You! If you be followers of the law you will join me in bringing justice to my sisters. Only then can we rebuild the world!\" and \"I will not tolerate questioning from you — I command, you obey; that is the law in my presence!\"",
												"- When interacting with characters of a chaotic alignment (suspiciously): \"I will be clear - I do not trust you. There will come a time when you will choose to submit to the law or you will become my enemy.\""
											]
										},
										"Kyreen will ally herself with chaotic-aligned characters only until her other sisters have been vanquished, at which point she will turn on and attack such characters exclusively, ignoring lawful-aligned allies — these she will view as poor, misguided souls who will be released from the twisted influence of chaos once it has been eliminated.",
										"While she does not remember specific details about her patron (her memory being blocked by Karthax), Kyreen will describe the following about the Great Cataclysm:",
										{
											"type": "list",
											"items": [
												"- The time before the Great Cataclysm was peaceful. Enlightened. All races were welcome, tolerated, and embraced. Kyreen misses her time in the great libraries of the world.",
												"- The Great Debate led into the Great Cataclysm by the actions of an unknown, would-be assassin who struck at one of the Eld Gods. This never would have happened if Order had been enforced on the mortal races.",
												"- Clearly the forces of chaos unleashed fire and flood and ripped the world apart. Only such beings could possibly release such chaotic forces without regard for the sanctity of life.",
												"- The Gods of Order have prevailed. Justice, might, and law now rule - chaos has been tamed, the world will be soothed and brought to a place of peace."

									"entries": [
										"As the youngest sister of three, Faradel always felt the need to keep up with her older sisters. In particular, she always admired Kyreen, whose intelligence and calm demeanor always seemed to keep Faradel's impulsive and tempestuous nature in check. From childhood onward Faradel was brash, quick to anger, and seldom hesitated to speak her mind where others might pause and debate if a wiser course of action might be in order. She was insatiably curious, and her mind, while it was not nearly as structured or disciplined as Kyreen's allowed her to see less conventional paths forward. This served her particularly well during the battles of the Great Cataclysm, where forces under her command would employ unorthodox tactics and often score decisive victories against otherwise superior forces.",
										"While Kyreen was pious and noble, Faradel believed that morals and rules would ultimately be the downfall of free will — the end would ultimately justify the means. In her view, the Eld Gods had allowed and encouraged the mortal races to explore their own, which was a clear license for power to rule and be overthrown in its own time by those more cunning or worthy.",
										"It was her numerous victories that ultimately led to her downfall, however. Becoming emboldened by her successes in battle, Faradel became more arrogant, more convinced in her superiority and that none could match her tactically. That is, until she was routed by an equally unorthodox ambush by Avilnar, who took advantage of a particularly brutal battle between forces led by Kyreen and Faradel — their forces both decimated by wave after wave of chaotic energies unleashed by Alvinar's band of corsairs.",
										"In her desperation, her forces weakened, demoralized, and near complete collapse, Faradel unleashed magic uncovered in ancient tomes long forgotten in the depths of one of the many monasteries she studied in. Whispering words of great power, she summoned forth the souls of the slain and offered them the opportunity to return to the world of the living once again. To the horror of the pitiful survivors on the field of battle, the dead walked the earth once more. Legions of her soldiers rose, along with a fewer number of Kyreen's and Alvinar's forces, who fled in the face of a renewed onslaught. This battle finally drew Faradel completely into darkness, warping and disfiguring her once comely figure into a twisted visage that matched her now completely blackened heart.",
										"Creatures whose souls are tainted by darkness were drawn to Faradel - magi thirsting for knowledge, mortals seeking unending life, worshippers of demons, and other such beings.",
										"Eventually a great final battle rained holy fire upon the Faradel's legions and her forces were exterminated. Faradel fled, seeking to recoup her losses and amass another freshly risen army. Relentlessly pursued by Kyreen to prevent such an occurrence, Faradel entered The Living Tower, bartering for time — a bargain Karthax was all too willing to accept.",

Now they would characterize her as the embodiment of darkness, who ultimately would sacrifice countless lives in the relentless pursuit of victory. While both her and Kyreen lead their followers with an iron fist, Kyreen maintains respect through her leadership — while Faradel's fist is bladed and invokes desperate fear in her followers — living and dead alike. Faradel is arrogant and contemptuous toward creatures who have morals and adhere to rules — be it decrees from on high, societal laws, or personal code of conduct. Convinced of her own superiority, she is also impatient and impulsive.",

									"entries": [
										"The middle of the three sisters, as a child Avilnar was always caught between her two sisters — disciplined, noble, virtuous Kyreen on one hand and impulsive, chaotic, and arrogant Faradel on the other. In Avilnar's view, both were bickering over trivial matters. The Eld Gods...debated over trivial matters. The only things that truly mattered were the actions of an individual in the moment, and each living creature was part of an interwoven web of singular choices carried out each day that created a grand masterpiece — the tapestry of life.",
										"Avilnar spent hours on end observing her siblings and their constant competition, inserting a few well chosen phrases, contradictions, and controversies into Kyreen's and Faradel's sometimes heated arguments. Both Kyreen and Faradel found Avilnar's comments infuriating to say the least, for it seemed the middle sibling's perspectives were constantly changing and mutable, never consistent enough to hold any substance. It seemed every other statement delivered by Avilnar was so outlandish it couldn't possibly hold any merit, and was delivered in such a nonchalant way that the two bickering siblings could never quite tell if Avilnar meant what she said — or if she was just manipulating the others.",
										"Avilnar took great delight in egging her siblings on, sometimes even merrily skipping away while leaving the others fuming at her — and each other. A keen observer of behavior, Avilnar mastered the ability to manipulate and antagonize others, bending them to her will sometimes for the sheer sake of doing so.",
										"Her mind was particularly adept at understanding and manipulating the subtler forces of magic — those of enchantments, illusions, and transmutations. Manipulating the thoughts and senses of other beings was as effortless to Avilnar as summoning a flicker of flame was to an evoker — thus she delighted in casting subtle spells upon others, enticing them to perform outlandish acts to the bewilderment of those around her.",
										"While she slept, Karthax planted visions in Avilnar's subconscious — hardening her to the inevitable conflict looming on the horizon. Avilnar's mind shifted from a once carefree, mischievous soul to one prepared for the grim realities of war.",
										"When the Great Cataclysm erupted, despite both her siblings imploring Avilnar to join them, she declined, each earning their hatred in return. Where both Kyreen and Faradel rose to lead great armies against one another, Avilnar led a modest force of corsairs determined to ensure freedom for all. Her forces, vastly outnumbered, relied on their cunning - setting elaborate traps, misdirecting through carefully-wrought illusions and enchantments, and eliminating key targets from either side in an effort to ensure neither side gained advantage for any length of time.",
										"All manner of mortals joined Avilnar's cause of their own volition, seeking neither power through force nor restricting the freedoms of others, but instead only the freedom to choose their own path — right or wrong be damned, they would make up their own minds. Thieves, assassins, warriors, mages, and free-minded folk of all races followed her.",
										"Both Kyreen and Faradel grew frustrated with repeated attacks against their forces by Avilnar's corsairs — they were unpredictable as her comments during their debates. Both cursed their sister, who carried out, at times, ruthless and unsavory acts against each. In return, both sent forth many hunters attempting to eliminate the thorn in their sides, but each time the master manipulator, weaver of illusions and enchantments, would dance out of their grasp.",
										"Once the Great Cataclysm had erupted and the forces of Order prevailed, she tracked Faradel to The Living Tower. Entering felt correct... as though she had sensed Karthax's presence before. She entered willingly, asking nothing for herself.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Avilnar.} As a particularly astute observer of behavior, Avilnar knows well the importance of putting on a disguise to mask her true intentions. She comes across as highly disinterested, airy, aloof, and uncaring, and uses this to test potential visitors to this floor. Unlike her siblings, who (unbeknownst to them due to Karthax's blocking of their minds) slaughter visitors to this floor once they have served their purpose, Avilnar has woven illusions and enchantments to protect a newcomer to this floor — a warrior, Amaalik, whom she has cleverly disguised as a harmless creature.",

												"When describing Kyreen:  \"{@i The poor, rigid thinker is so blinded by her rules she cannot see that in her quest for good she created great evil in return. Her blindness allows her to be so easily manipulated. Predictable as always she is — rules and order, blah blah blah.}\"",

For generations, his family has contentedly fished the frigid waters, eking out a modest living and on occasion setting forth with his parents and brother to trade seal furs, bone carvings, and fish for necessities such as salt, sugar, iron cookware, and weapons.",
										"Constantly in the shadows of his more clever brother (whom Aamalik felt was favored by his parents) and spending his days fishing, Amaalik tired of his mundane existence and set forth to do something few in his village could conceive: to find a new path.",
										"Having never received a formal education, Aamalik was often looked upon with curiosity by others during his travels. As his social engagements were limited to the village in which he grew up, where there was little time for idle chit chat or frivolities, Aamalik's personality could be described as abrasive and abrupt. Feeling an acute need to prove himself more than just a humble fisherman, Amaalik is a strong, if untrained, fighter, courageous and inquisitive. It was this curiosity that led him to The Living Tower, which offered him the opportunity to be viewed as more than just a humble fisherman in exchange for entrance.",

Descended from a line of powerful shamans, Hjálmŷr quickly rose through the tribal ranks, and despite standing only 18-feet-tall (small for a frost giant), quickly becoming a warrior renowned not only for his ferocity and prowess in battle, but also for his cunning and intelligence. More than a worthy opponent to other rivals within his clan, Hjálmŷr quickly earned the respect of older and more seasoned warriors.",
								"Never satisfied with achieving renown as a warrior, in his arrogance Hjálmŷr set his mind on a more enticing prize — being recognized as Jarl of his tribe. After amassing a significant following, Hjálmŷr set about challenging the incumbent Jarl for their seat at the warrior's throne — a hallowed throne constructed of dragon bones and the weapons of conquered enemies. Despite his cunning, Hjálmŷr was blinded by arrogance and lust for the coveted throne — and was thus betrayed by his followers. After a fierce battle, Hjálmŷr’s followers were slain.",
								"Bloodied, battered, and broken, the current Jarl decreed that rather than honor Hjálmŷr with a warrior’s death, instead he would be shunned by all the northern frost giant clans and cast out from his home range. Should Hjálmŷr even step foot in their lands again, he would be forever denied his place at the All-Father’s table with his ancestors.",
								"Denied what he viewed as his rightful place as Jarl, Hjálmŷr descended from his mountain range with a seething desire to seek power and overthrow those who cast him out. Soon Hjálmŷr would have vengeance.",
								"Communicating with ancestral spirits that had also been denied their place at the All-Father’s table, Hjálmŷr began to unlock forbidden and nearly forgotten magical secrets. However, Hjálmŷr was not content with merely being able to summon the spirits of long slain warriors and binding others to his will. Once he tasted of the chalice of power, he relentlessly thirsted for more, and was lured by Karthax. Seeking to achieve unimaginable power, Karthax ensnared Hjálmŷr, offering precisely what Hjálmŷr desired — unimaginable magical powers and  a Jarl’s seat within The Living Tower. In exchange, Hjálmŷr would remain Karthax’s...guest...until such time he would be released once more upon the world to seek his vengeance.",
								"To this day, Hjálmŷr sits upon a throne of death within the tower, a self-proclaimed Jarl who rules over the spirits of the dead and longs for the day when he might unleash his new-found might.",

								"Before the Great Cataclysm, the region in which The Living Tower stands was once a hot, humid jungle near a dormant volcano. Countless species of plants and animals thrived in this environment, and the tribes of mortal species that lived within had an abundance of food. Deep lakes and rivers crisscrossed the land filled with fish, eels, and waterfowl; the great, ancient trees supported countless species of animals both beneath on the shadowy jungle floor and within a canopy that produced a diversity of fruit and other foods undreamed of. Medicinal plants were common, and the denizens of this jungle were prosperous.",
								"Despite the relative peace of this jungle, there were nonetheless dangerous threats throughout. Large caimans lurked amidst calmer waterways, great cats stalked game from the dense foliage, and even the inhabitants of the jungle would on occasion wage war amongst themselves. The greatest of these predators were the fiercely territorial hydras — ravenous multi-headed reptilian creatures that dwelled within some of the more boggy wetlands within the region.",
								"The tribes that dwelled within this region were for the most part isolated from greater society, and despite numerous pilgrimages from the so-called civilized outer world to enlighten these reclusive bands in the ways of the Eld Gods, seldom could they find them. Frequently such visitors were afflicted with virulent jungle fevers, lost within the tangle and driven mad before eventually finding their way out once again, or simply never heard from again.",
								"Despite limited contact with the outside world and even less knowledge of events therein, the Great Cataclysm would decimate this ecosystem. In their fury, the Eld Gods raised a great fire mountain from within the depths of the jungle, one that would spew forth countless tons of ash and poisonous sulfurous gas into the atmosphere. The violent magics that raised this volcano laid waste to the jungle, annihilating almost all of the region and those within in but a few short days. Creatures that could flee did so, but most perished — engulfed in a pyroclastic flow that consumed their bodies or showered them with molten rock. Only a few pitiful remnants of this once glorious tribute to life would survive its transformation into a barren wasteland of ash and dust.",
								"At the edge of the jungle, a hydra nest nestled against a peaceful riverbank that contained a single egg was miraculously spared from the pyroclastic flow and volcanic bombs that rained down upon the region. Hatching amidst the chaos and destruction, and just as the choking volcanic gasses were dissipating, the young hydra found an abundance of food. Not needing to hunt nor compete with other predators, the hydra — the last of its kind — rapidly grew to an enormous size.",
								"When Karthax constructed The Living Tower, the hydra, known as Khuzza, was beginning to run out of easy prey. Seeing the great creature and knowing that the species would soon become extinct without divine intervention, Karthax brought Khuzza within. Countless visitors to the tower have since satiated the great reptile."

Seeing the deepest fears and fondest wishes of those they consumed only made Acythylass thirst for more, and as such, the creature developed a reputation for being the most cruel and ruthless of their kind.",
								"All was well in Acythylass' cruel and blood-soaked world — until the true gods arrived and destroyed all that their civilization had built. The survivors of the once-glorious empire scattered, among them Acythylass, who fled deeper and deeper into the Abyss.",
								"By sheer happenstance, Acythylass came upon an underwater portal to a different realm. Fearing for their life at the hands of those that others would deem the true gods, Acythylass fled within the portal, emerging into a new world, one whose depths were filled with all manner of creatures yet untouched by the malevolent presence of the aboleths. Thus Acythylass had at last found the perfect refuge from which to reconstruct a new empire, one of their own imagination, which they could rule over without interference from those filthy self-proclaimed gods — or so they thought.",
								"While this new world was untouched and ripe for conquest; it was also wild and savage. Creatures of the depths unseen and unencountered by Acythylass, their ancestors, or those whose minds they consumed lurked in the great abyssal depths of this new world.",

Over centuries, Acythylass, now known as the Ancient One to their subjects, began to construct a new and vast empire beneath the waves — that is, until the seas boiled with fury the likes Acythylass had never before encountered.",

										"For the sake of the pitiful mortal beings that call this world home, suffice to say that Acythylass the Ancient, was once a powerful overlord in another world. The Ancient and their brethren were responsible for the enslavement of countless beings, and as a cruel and merciless ruler directed the construction of a great underwater civilization that spanned the ocean. Their rule was absolute, until the true gods (or were they god-like beings?) arrived in their world. In their self-righteous ways these beings waged a great war against the primordials, eventually triumphing over the ancient ones and driving the few that remained into the depths.",

The primordial beings, reduced to bickering amongst themselves and vying for supremacy, scattered across the seas. Alone, Acythylass came to an underwater maelstrom that proved to be an underwater portal to...elsewhere.",
										"Seeing an opportunity to flee this realm and perhaps build a new civilization, more glorious than the last, Acythylass entered the maelstrom, emerging into a sea teeming with an abundance of life the likes they had never before seen.",
										"The primordial set about their task with fervor, conquering the simple-minded underwater denizens of this world with ease, consuming the minds of those who would not bend to their will. Known to their subjects only as the Ancient One, they set about crafting a new underwater empire. More than that, armed with the knowledge of the existence of other worlds, perhaps linked by portals such as the one that brought them here, Acythylass began scheming to conquer not only the seas of this world, but of others as well.",
										"Over several centuries, Acythylass consolidated their power, bred formidable offspring containing the genetic memory of their hermaphroditic parent, and carved out an empire in the northern seas that surface dwellers feared to sail with their flimsy wooden vessels. Those who were bold, foolish, or plain stupid enough to try to traverse these waters quickly met a watery grave. Those who were strong enough to resist the Ancient One's minions were psionically dominated and kept as servitors who would obey their every whim.",

										"Rockslides buried the newly constructed cities Acythylass' followers had toiled to build. Multiple maelstroms opened and consumed the Ancient One's progeny, their fate unknown. Tidal waves swept all but a pitiful few of Acythylass' followers onto the shore where they perished beneath a withering sun.",
										"Acythylass fled once again, seeking refuge within a complex underwater cavern system beneath the main continent of this world. There, safe from the ravages unleashed by the Great Cataclysm, Acythylass tentatively reached out with their psionic energies, touching the mind of a powerful being that seemed...familiar.",
										"Following this mind, Acythylass came to the foundation of a relatively newly constructed tower, perhaps only a few years old. The Ancient One, wary of the presence of a powerful so-called god, also saw opportunity, for it seemed the god-like presence that identified itself as Karthax was unfamiliar with the primordials.",
										"Likewise, Karthax saw an opportunity engaging with the primordial, for never had they encountered such a strange being whose mind was so foreign to that of the mortal denizens of this world.",
										"The two beings — Ancient One and Eld God — thus began slowly learning about one another, always probing, always debating, always seeking an advantage or secret knowledge the other might possess. Allowing this strange being from elsewhere access at will to the submerged cavern system beneath the wastelands and into The Living Tower suited Karthax well. Not only did the Eld God slowly begin to learn the ways of a being so unlike anything they encountered, but it also provided the Eld God with the opportunity to debate with a highly intelligent being. In exchange, Acythylass was provided with shelter and — unbenownst to Karthax — the opportunity to study, and perhaps even seek vengeance, against one of the self-proclaimed Gods that had ruined the Ancient One's rule so many millennia ago.",

										"A somewhat prickly and grumpy gnomish diviner, Fargrim Sunffbottom comes from a long line of gnomes renowned for their magical abilities — though his family is perhaps even better known for their unique brew of turnip ale. Standing a proud 3 feet 6 inches tall and weighing a healthy 3 stone (42 lbs), Fargrim is both proud and stubborn. Gnomish children in his village would frequently evade Fargrim whenever he would trundle down the streets and alleys with the support of his staff, ducking away from his glare - for he had a fearsome reputation for being impatient and ornery, particularly with children — for the old gnome had little time for shenanigans and pranks.",
										"Yet despite his outward hard exterior and gruffness, the bearded, white-haired old gnome cares deeply about his family, friends, and village — including the children, as well.",
										"While content to run the brewery that had been in his family for several generations, Fargrim would on occasion seek to glimpse into the future. On most occasions but a few fleeting images would come to the gnome; yet on one fateful night, perhaps notable for his testing of a new ale recipe perhaps a bit excessively, a vision as clear as the spring water used in his brews came to Fargrim.",
										"First, Fargrim beheld the sight of a teetering stone tower in a blasted wasteland. He beheld an image of a being of light, so bright and beautiful they nearly blinded him. Reaching out, the being released nine gemstones: four (a pearl, ruby, diamond, and onyx) burned brightly with an inner fire, levitating above the others. One, what appeared to be jade, barely levitated and only hinted at an inner light. Three (a sapphire, emerald, and topaz) remained in the being's hand, clasped tightly. The final gemstone — an ever-changing opal that reflected the being's light into countless colors, levitated apart from the others.",
										"Countless images then rapidly flashed before Fargrim's eyes: of legions of horned, cloven-footed creatures bearing vicious weapons, of great armies clashing. Of bound and chained beings of many races, marching along worn paths into the distance while carrion crows circled above.",
										 "Fargrim beheld images of great battles — of strife and conflict. Such visions brought the old gnome to his knees, before he saw the tower once more — illuminated by a ray of light that caused it to crumble and collapse. The last of the premonitions was a telepathic voice reaching out to him: \"The time is nigh. In the north, the fate of free will shall be decided.\"",
										 "Head throbbing, Fargrim awoke in a cold sweat from what he had beheld. Determined to prevent the calamities he had just witnessed from coming to pass, that very day the wizard set forth, trusty staff in hand and the adventurer's pack from his father upon his back.",
										 "For several months, Fargrim traveled north, always inquiring from the locals if they knew of a crumbling tower in a barren wasteland, yet most simply looked queerly at the gnome — clearly too old for adventuring — as though he was a lunatic. One local, however, told Fargrim of a new mining venture to the north, where gemstones of great value had been discovered. Perhaps there Fargrim might find the answers he sought?",
										 "With newfound hope and determination, Fargrim continued onward, his divinations burned into his memories.",
										 "Within one of the many taverns set up to quench the thirst of the newly wealthy miners, Fargrim came across a charming adventurer on the same path, who had also heard of the crumbling tower. The stranger accompanied Fargrim into the barrens, where they finally — exhausted, dusty, and with food and water depleted — came to the crumbling tower Fargrim beheld in his vision. Turning to thank his companion, Fargrim was shocked to find he had disappeared with nary a trace.",
										 "Entering the tower, Fargrim was immediately addressed by a telepathic voice: \"I have been waiting...welcome to my tower! Enter, and you may find the answers you seek...\"",
										 "Completely alone and armed with only his wits and skills as a wizard, Fargrim entered without hesitation.",
										 "His wiles have allowed the lone gnome to outwit many of the foes in The Living Tower — having escaped from Krul'Thunk, the three sisters, as well as Jarl Hjálmŷr before coming to this floor, which Fargrim is just beginning to explore.",
										 "{@b Roleplaying Fargrim Snuffbottom.} Fargrim Snuffbottom is an old, stubborn, and cantankerous gnome. While at first he may come across as argumentative, even offensive to some, Fargrim will listen carefully and, should a course of action make sense, relent and eventually help others out. Having been treated poorly whenever he shared his vision, the gnome will reluctantly describe it and his journey to The Living Tower if pressed.

The table has been organized in this manner so GMs can easily pick taunts for a current or upcoming floor if they wish. In addition to the d100 Karthax's Quips table, there are nine d6 Karthax's Tips tables, one for each floor of The Living Tower.
