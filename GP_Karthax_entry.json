								"The orc race, with their imposing physical and fearsome presence often strike fear into the hearts of the more populous and common mortal races. Yet this race is often misunderstood — while they value physical prowess and strength of arms above all else, they also have a strict code of honor that most members of their species rigidly adhere to. A proud species, orcs are prone to be easily offended by those not familiar with their ways, a factor which perhaps leads to other races' perceptions of them.",
								"Orcish society is patriarchal, with strong, prominent chieftains often siring equally strong offspring that in turn are groomed from a young age to lead a clan with honor and dignity. Orcish society is loosely divided into three castes. The warrior caste has a prominent role within orcish societies and will often lead sorties against the settlements of other species, for conquest earns both gold and resources as well as renown and respect within orcish society. The crafter  caste, the most numerous in orcish society, consists of those orcs who both till the earth for food as well as builders responsible for the construction of orcish settlements and forging of weapons and armor. The final caste, ritualists, is charged with preserving the ancestral knowledge of their species, and pass the lore of their people down through generations. This caste is revered, for they summon forth ancestral spirits thought to bring gentle rains that nourish crops, ensure hunters arrows are true, and bless particularly strong warrior bloodlines with fertility.",
								"While orcs generally choose to live in peace far from other races, the discovery of precious metals and gems (specifically sanguarite) within the wastelands has led to an encroachment on orcish territory by other races pursuing the newly discovered wealth within. Warriors and scouts were dispatched to observe the intruders and take note of their strength. However, several prominent members of the ritualist caste argued forcefully that these invaders must be driven back from orcish territory.",
								"Dhugar Bloodsinger, the most prominent among these ritualists, led a powerful raiding party against a group of steadholders that began construction of a new frontier settlement upon orcish grounds. This raiding party included a number of orcish warriors and other ritualists who laid waste to the settlement.",
								"Druvok Steelhead, brother of Dhugar Bloodsinger, led a smaller group in an effort to intercept his brother and prevent an escalation in hostilities with the other nearby races. Their pursuit was too late. Druvok thus set out in pursuit of his brother, who was also pursued by the remnants of the steadholders into the wastelands in which The Living Tower is hidden.",
								"Dhugar and his remaining forces entered The Living Tower, bartering with Karthax for escape from the furious surviving steadholders. These steadholders, pursuing revenge, were offered as much and entered shortly thereafter. Druvok and his hunters, seeking to restore honor to their clan by bringing Dhugar to justice, entered perhaps a few hours later."

								"As with so many adventurers, the pursuit of an orcish raiding party has led a band of adventurers to The Living Tower, where they were offered and accepted entrance. This particular floor is a simple exploration, and while there are hints to the magical nature of The Living Tower — notably an inability to escape to the main floor as well as a desecrated ancient shrine used by Dhugar Bloodsinger to initiate a forbidden blood ritual using the sacred sanguarite to summon an ancestral blood spirit to destroy their enemies that was once a part of an ancient temple devoted to the worship of the Eld Gods.",
								"As with much of The Living Tower, not everything is as it seems. While there are common stereotypes regarding the orcish race throughout many genres, in the world we envision, orcs are often misunderstood due to their appearance and cultural value on physical strength. In fact, in most cities outside the relatively wild frontier region, they are highly regarded for their strength and strong sense of honor, and are welcomed as opposed to regarded with suspicion.",

										"While Druvok will initially regard the adventurers with a healthy dose of suspicion, if they prove to be beings of honor, Druvok and his party will likely choose to ally with them in an effort to bring his brother to justice and restore honor to his clan.",
										"A number of clues and hints to the ancient nature of The Living Tower may be found within this floor: the magical barriers preventing escape, the ancient shrine devoted to Karthax used by his long-deceased followers, and the omniscient but subtle presence of Karthax constantly observing the adventurers.",
										"This floor is also inhabited by Paewyn Tealeaf, an intrepid explorer and treasure hunter, who has a fondness for orcs thanks to having one as an adopted younger brother.",
										"An aldravex - a tiny, squirrel-like treasure hunting creature able to detect precious metals and gems is also exploring this floor in a search for treasure. It may lead the adventurers to a hidden treasure room or to the {@b Sanguarite Amulet} held by Dhugar Bloodsinger."

										"An orc of the ritualist caste, Dhugar Bloodsinger was identified at birth by one of the oldest and most revered orcish shamans as one who was particularly attuned to the spirit world. Despite the fact Dhugar's father was a mighty warrior respected within the clan, the young orc had a hunched posture and was relatively weak physically, in stark contrast to his formidable older brother, Druvok. Yet despite his sickly frame and malformed spine, Dhugar was revered by those within his tribe thanks to the premonitions of the shaman at his birth. Such reverence led to the young orc developing an arrogant attitude as well as a superiority complex. Despite the elder ritualists' attempts to temper the young orc's attitude with teachings of humility and service toward his clan, as well as the occasional harsh lesson delivered by a stout oak stave, Dhugar nonetheless maintained a belief that he was destined for greatness.",
										"Dhugar's attitude often led to conflict with other orcs his age, in particular Druvok. Where Dhugar was small in stature, clever, manipulative, and could begin ritualistic incantations even at a young age, Druvok was powerful, formidable in stature, and regarded by the clan as a soon-to-be mighty warrior capable of bringing much honor to his family. This led to Dhugar resenting his brother, where he perhaps would have been better served humbly pursuing the ritualist path ordained for him at birth.",
										"Despite his resentment, Dhugar grew in knowledge and power, and soon became a widely respected shaman while his brother was leading raiding parties against other clans, as well as other races.",
										"Ever jealous, however, Dhugar sought to sway the favor of members of the crafter caste toward himself. Thus the ritualist began increasing his influence and amassing a band of followers, counter to the teachings of the elder shamans who taught him the ways of the spirit world.",
										"When other races began to settle near the lands of his clan, the arrogant and power-hungry shaman grew increasingly agitated and frustrated with a perceived lack of action advocated by Druvok and members of the warrior caste. Druvok, having battled numerous times against the members of other species, knew well their threat, and that the rapidly increasing numbers of expeditionary forces toward the nearby wastelands might lead to conflict that would likely lead to the extermination of their clan. The steadholders, settlers, and miners had not yet become aware of the orc clan. Druvok did not yet know their true strength and the settler's true motivations — important factors before choosing to engage in open war.",
										"Despite his older brother's hesitations, Dhugar and his followers chose to attack first and drive away the trespassers before they became too powerful to overcome.",
										"The raid itself was rather successful, but the ritualist's lack of battle experience resulted in many wounded followers. Nonetheless, they were able to eliminate most of the steadholders, liberating a prestine Sanguarite Amulet (a stone said to allow a ritualist to commune with orcish ancestral spirits) in the process.",
										"Dhugar Bloodsinger and his followers retreated into the wastelands, erroneously believing the vengeful steadholders would not pursue them. They traveled at pace, and at times some orcs would lose their way, ensnared by the illusions and enchantments concealing The Living Tower in their wounded state.",
										"After several days of being pursued, Dhugar's depleted band of followers pierced the illusory shroud surrounding The Living Tower, and in exchange for escape from their steadholder pursuers, were offered entrance into The Living Tower.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Dhugar Bloodsinger.} Dhugar Bloodsinger is an orc of small stature, hunched over and cloaked in a humble ritualist's cloak. A shrewd and calculating orc, Dhugar is cunning and perceptive, as well. Having been taught by other shamans of his clan from a young age, Dhugar is capable of summoning fourth ancestral spirits, as well as wielding blood magic that is typically used by ritualists to bless both land and clan with fertility. Dhugar can be portrayed as follows:",

										"The elder brother of Dhugar Bloodsinger, Druvok Steelhead has been trained in the ways of the warrior by the armsmasters of their clan from a young age. In his youth, he participated in countless battles of strength with other younglings — few of whom could match his strength or speed with an axe.",
										"Seeing much potential in the young warrior, Druvok was chosen by his tribe to lead his first war party against a rival clan at a particularly young age. It was during this raid that the orc earned his second name, steelhead — for an opponent very nearly took his head, instead shearing a portion of his scalp away. Once the raid was complete, a crafter molded a piece of steel to fit in place of his scalp, which was in turn healed by a ritualist and infused into his skull as a badge of honor for his first raid.",
										"Despite his fearsome appearance, Druvok adheres to a strict warrior code — to take a life only when needed, and to seek honor and renown in both battle and service to his clan.",
										"The scheming and machinations of his younger brother, Dhugar Bloodsinger, often caused Druvok to regard him with suspicion, for the warrior could not predict the actions of one who does not adhere to a code of honor.",
										"It thus came as no surprise to Druvok when Dhugar led a band of overzealous followers to destroy a band of steadholders; the rash ritualist failing to observe his enemy before striking. Learning of this raid, Druvok led a small warband to attempt to intercept the ritualist, but not arriving in time to prevent an unnecessary slaughter counter to the warrior's code.",
										"Seeing that his younger brother was being pursued by a vengeful mob of steadholders, Druvok and his band of hunters set forth in pursuit, taking care to conceal their presence from additional pursuit, before coming to the entrance to The Living Tower. There, Karthax offered the orcish warrior the opportunity to pursue his brother, bring him to justice, and restore honor to his tribe.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Druvok Steelhead.} A powerful orcish warrior, Druvok Steelhead is calculating and thoughtful, yet decisive once a course of action has been decided upon.",
										"The orc speaks in low, guttural tones, but with an underlying thoughtfulness that indicates he is able to work through the mindset of others. Unlike many other orc warriors who draw steel first and ask questions later, Druvok will engage others before blood is spilled unnecessarily.",

										"As a young child, Paewyn Tealeaf grew up in a large desert city that was a major trade center. Merchants hawking their wares, trade caravans passed through daily bearing all manner of goods, and wealthy nobles sought exotic rarities to add to their collection. She was part of a family consisting of her adopted father, a very clever halfling merchant, an elven mother of noble heart who often took in the urchins and poor children of the city, and a young orcish brother who was also taken in by their adopted parents. While initially wary of her larger sibling from a young age, the two quickly embraced each other with their tendency toward finding all manner of trouble as they grew.",
										"Paewyn was nimble of both mind and hand and she learned from her paternal uncle the skills one could not learn in a school — to pick locks and pockets as well as to conceal (and use) daggers with which to protect herself. She quickly developed quite the reputation and few would cross her after a glance at her hulking brother.",
										"While initially her exploits centered around relieving the wealthy of their gold and jewels (they would hardly miss them, she would rationalize), Paewyn grew bored of such simple thievery. Thus she and her brother would begin to venture into the desert, seeking ancient ruins and mausoleums to explore, seeking treasures with which to expand her father's business — which she had since taken over as \"Tealeaf Treasures\", an enterprise selling adventuring equipment as well as the occasional item liberated from the tombs of the dead.",
										"Her exploits grew more and more bold, her business dealings becoming more shadowy, and her thirst for exploration became insatiable. Paewyn had heard rumors of ancient ruins and treasures to the north, uncovered by new mining operations that had seemingly sprung up overnight. Thus the intrepid young girl left the family business entrusted to her brother and ventured forth for what she thought would be but a few short months.",
										"Paewyn made her way to the mining camps uncovering ancient ruined statues depicting a long lost civilization — some said the region was once inhabited by one of the Eld Gods. The rumors of newly discovered ruins turned out to be false. However, on the day Paewyn was set to leave in disappointment, a half-starved human stumbled into the camp, rambling about a shattered tower and a massive two-headed monster. Those who cared for the traveler, clearly driven mad with thirst, dismissed his ramblings, but Paewyn, her mood soaring at the potential adventure, set forth into the wastelands instead, coming across The Living Tower with relative ease. There, Karthax offered what she desired most — treasure and adventure — in exchange for a bit of time within the tower.",

								"Ettins are hardly known for either their personal hygiene or for their charming and engaging social skills. Ettins in particular are solitary creatures, perhaps due to the tendency of their two heads to endlessly bicker with one another, often descending into crude shouting matches littered with name-calling and insults between each other, let alone with any nearby beings who have the misfortune of hearing such relentless bickering. However, they have been known to engage with other creatures such as ogres who, either due to their lack of wit, care, or hearing, are able to tolerate the presence of an ettin.",
								"While predominantly boorish and crude, on rare occasions, an ettin is born with a rare gift: that of a greater intelligence (at least in one head), and even more rarely, of a limited ability to manipulate magical energies. Born in a den littered with cracked bones sucked dry of marrow and with animal hides strewn about, one such rare ettin had the double fortune of having a mother that actually had an inkling of maternal instincts. Their mother named the obviously more intelligent head Krul, for this male head appeared to be much more cruel than the typical ettin, and the more typically dense and unintelligent second head Thunk, after the sound a club makes upon impact.",
								"As a young ettin, their mother recognized that Krul'Thunk - or more specifically Krul - had a unique curiosity and could interpret the markings on the inside of the cave in which they lived for a time.",
								"While most ettins hunt only wild game to provide to their offspring until they are able to hunt for themselves, Krul'Thunk's mother instead began hunting humanoids not for food, but rather for the flimsy \"books\" they sometimes carried. Thus Krul was not only provided for in terms of food, but also with knowledge. One such book happened to be an unfortunate wizard's spellbook, and by the time Krul'Thunk was old enough to hunt for themselves, Krul was also able to cast some simple magic spells.",
								"Krul, ever curious and thirsty for more of this power they seemed to be able to control, constantly kept Thunk engaged with the promise of more \"shiny things\" pilfered from other humanoids. Thus they hunted smaller, weaker humanoids, in particular wizards, sorcerers, or anyone who looked like they might have books on their person. Krul learned more, and Thunk was well fed - both heads were content. They even took additional companions, for ogres in particular seemed to almost enjoy being told what to do by Krul.",
								"In their wanderings, Krul's magical attunement grew, and Krul'Thunk was eventually drawn by sheer happenstance to The Living Tower. Promised by Karthax as many books as Krul could read in exchange for their service within the tower, Krul'Thunk settled within one of the lower floors where Krul could constantly read and experiment with their magic, and Thunk would be endlessly entertained both with visitors to The Living Tower as well as by Krul's sometimes spectacular failures at manipulating arcane energies."

Creatures who encounter Krul'Thunk often hear (and smell) the ettin magus before they see them, as Thunk is nearly always yelling at Krul for some perceived slight (which is more than often accurate) in vulgar terms with a deep, slow voice. By contrast, Krul speaks much more quickly, in a higher-pitched nasal tone.

From beneath this helmet, his red, beady eyes frequently squint with malice, particularly when attempting to concoct something vaguely resembling \"a plan.\" His face bears countless burn marks, his scraggly facial hair singed in places thanks to the threats that Krul sometimes follows through with, or the result of Krul's frequent tinkering with magic.",

Krul has a particular fondness for fire as well, and his eyes at times appear to blaze, particularly when angry or impatient.",

Krul will barter for books or knowledge, but if denied will simply use Thunk and the ogres to coerce visitors.

Rather than drift away on a gossamer strand with the gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the forest, the ravenous hatchling began to feast on her still developing siblings until only she remained. This particular spiderling was unique in that her body was rapidly able to metabolize whatever it consumed and shift its physiology, adapting any beneficial genetic traits it encountered while discarding less beneficial traits. The spiderling wasn't aware its body was doing this, but as she consumed her siblings, she slowly became self aware.",
								"The ravenous spider rapidly grew, and within her first season, had grown to the point where she was no longer content with consuming mosquitos and the odd juicy fly, but was weaving webs to catch sparrows, finches, and other small songbirds. When it was time for most spiders to lay their egg clutches and accept the inevitability of the cycle of nature, this spider was unwilling to do so. Her rapidly mutating genetics meant that the cellular decline that accompanied aging and ultimately death no longer applied. But the spider hid away during the winter, burying herself deep within a lair in the forest floor.",
								"When she awoke, the spider was unimaginably ravenous and had grown even larger - her second season was spent hunting and consuming squirrels, hares, and other small game trapped by her webs.",
								"By her fourth season, the spider was the terror of the forest, devouring deer and larger game. But all were of inferior genetics...until she encountered one of the creatures known as humans.",
								"The first one the spider consumed was beyond delicious, and her body shifted countless traits that allowed the spider to develop a consciousness, and even a language. Thus she began hunting this most delicious source of information - until they began hunting her in return.",
								"Unable to repel countless waves of her delicious but vicious favorite food, the spider — dubbed Sryytyl the devourer by these tender morsels (the spider quite liked that name) — was ultimately driven from the forest she called home to seek new hunting grounds.",
								"This pattern continued for some time — seeking new hunting grounds with naive prey before being driven away by them. Finally, Sryytyl came across a newly constructed tower in the midst of a wasteland. Starving and somewhat weakened from a lack of prey, she climbed the tower, coming to a floor through which a lone window was magically being sealed. Sryytyl slipped within, unbeknownst to the powerful consciousness she felt within the magical walls of the tower.",

To add to these dangers, magical illusions and curses are often layered upon each other in the central rooms of these tombs. Several recently discovered tombs contain brilliantly colored murals depicting ancient life, as well as creatures thought to exist only in the dreams and fantasies of mortals.",

Centuries of experimentation with magics now viewed as evil or forbidden were conducted in an effort to reveal the secrets of death. Priests and priestesses were thus of great importance, having the power to guide souls into the afterlife. The dead were entombed in grand tombs along with immeasurable wealth to ensure favorable passage of the soul to its next journey.",

She was able to separate her soul from her body, which was then magically sealed in an ornate vessel and hidden away in a secret location. Her body was preserved by the skilled practitioners of mummification and thus endured the ravages of time. Nephetes-em-Xhakar became known as the Deathless Lady.",

								"When the magics summoned by the Eld Gods during the Great Cataclysm caused the fire mountain containing the Deathless Lady's tomb to erupt, she awoke from her millennia-long slumber within her tomb. At the height of the Great Cataclysm, when Karthax constructed The Living Tower, the stone of her tomb was woven into its foundation and Karthax offered a bargain: the location of the vessel containing the Deathless Lady's soul if she but stayed for a while longer within The Living Tower."

They may even attempt to lure visitors into the traps built into this floor, magical and physical — but doing so in subtle ways to avoid suspicion.",

										"The {@b Inmortui Enchiridion} in the Disciple's Table room (Area 12) was penned by the Deathless Lady some many years ago, prior to her transformation.",
										"The Deathless Lady, while weakened by time and distance from her soul, remains formidable. She will not necessarily attack, but may implore Karthax to release the visitors from her floor should one of them swear fealty to her and undergo a ritual to become undead. Her motivation is not to kill indiscriminately, but rather to spread what she perceives as the power of immortality to all who would have it — thus she requires a representative to the outside world willing to spread her word.",

										"Her knowledge was highly sought after, and Nephetes — taking the honorific em-Xhakar once she had been brought into the upper echelons of the priesthood — was soon sought after by nobles who would implore her to present their wishes, plights, and deepest desires to the gods on their behalf. Many of these nobles, their coffers awash with wealth, wanted for nothing, but feared for their immortal souls. Indeed, this civilization had become obsessed with wealth as well as the fate of their souls.",
										"Seeing the worries of nobles and the commoner alike, Nephetes-em-Xhakar began to search for answers within the teachings of the gods — she began a quest to uncover the secret to immortality. Long had this civilization practiced mummification and other means of preserving the body, as well as constructing monuments to protect both body and soul once they had been parted by age, disease, or war; however, none had perfected the means to preserve the link between body and soul even if separated.",
										"Knowing the link between body and soul was crucial to maintaining life after death, Nephetes-em-Xhakar experimented with countless rituals and incantations. She found eager volunteers for her experimental incantations and spells, such was her reputation among the people that they were willing to risk their bodies and souls for even the chance at immortality. Nephetes-em-Xhakar thus tested her necromantic spells on thousands of willing victims who offered themselves as sacrifices in rituals devoted to blood gods, night gods, moon gods, gods of the earth — any who might bestow a deathless life upon a willing soul.",
										"Deeper she delved into ever darker necromantic teachings. Eventually, with an occult and twisted ceremony devoted to one of the least known deities, Nephetes-em-Xhakar was able to separate a soul — her own — from her body by sacrificing the willing life-essence of her followers, and was able to store her soul within an ornate canopic jar that was magically rendered nigh indestructible. Her body was mummified to preserve it, however, and would resemble that of an ancient, wizened crone  forever more. The secrets of undeath had been unleashed upon the world.",
										"Over the next century or so, Nephetes-em-Xhakar was worshiped as a demigoddess by her people. She guarded her incantations and rituals jealousy, and amassed a following and wealth that rivaled even the most powerful of the rulers of the time, whom she ritualistically slew and raised again as legions of immortal undead to serve her every whim. The descendants of these undead exist to this day, the undead trait passed on through necromantic incantation or cursed bite alike.",
										"However, with power came suspicion and paranoia. Fearing for her soul contained within a canopic jar, Nephetes-em-Xhakar entrusted it to one of her most loyal servants who hid it deep within a tomb of some long deceased noble among others just like it. No one but that one loyal servant knew of its location, and after it was hidden, they were slain — preserving Nephetes-em-Xhakar's soul forever.",
										"Her paranoia proved correct. Nephetes-em-Xhakar's body was subdued by a jealous cohort of nobles who feared her power over the undead, entombed, and spirited away far to the North. There, a tomb was constructed beneath a great dormant volcano and hidden deep within the stone. Traps of all kinds, magical and mundane, as well as illusions, enchantments, and any number of incantations were cast to prevent the tomb's discovery and penetration by would-be tomb raiders. Several of her servants were also entombed within to watch over the  Deathless Lady, to ensure she would not ever be set free.",
										"The tomb remained silent, sealed, for millennia until Karthax raised The Living Tower out of the blasted wastelands decimated by the resurrecting of the extinct firemountain.  The Deathless Lady had by then awoken, and as The Living Tower was being constructed, sensed freedom was within her grasp. However, time and distance from her soul, sealed in a location unknown even to her, had stripped her of much of her power. Thus, while Karthax was raising The Living Tower, the Deathless Lady made a deal with the Eld God: the location of the canopic jar containing her soul in exchange for but a few centuries more.

										"Raquel Saqat is a holy warrior whose bloodline bears the origins of the Eld Gods, be it through procreation or simply being one of the chosen imbued with magical powers from these beings. Bearing the signs of being touched by the Eld Gods — feathered wings erupting from between his shoulders — Raquel's family chose a simple life in a remote village far from where their origins would be scrutinized. Hiding their true nature, Raquel's parents were strict and disciplined, their loyalty directed to a lesser noble who tolerated no disloyalty and commanded absolute obedience from his subjects.",
										"The young Raquel was initiated into a warrior order at a relatively young age, and distinguished himself well as a loyal servant to his lord. Raquel became a paladin of some renown, known for bringing the firm, steel fist of justice wherever the innocent were wronged. All was well until a minor conflict with a neighboring noble escalated. Raquel and his soldiers were dispatched to resolve the conflict, but came across a massacre of villagers under his lord's protection. Furious, the warrior sought his lord's permission to bring the perpetrators to justice.",
										"The unthinkable occurred: his lord, whom Raquel revered and obeyed unerringly, forbade the paladin from pursuing the murderers, for it was an effort to goad Raquel's house into a conflict with a vastly superior force. Raquel was forbidden from bringing those responsible to justice — for political reasons he could not understand.",
										"Torn between loyalty and his sense of right, the paladin chose justice — though some might call it vengeance — and abandoned his lord. Alone, the conflicted paladin unleashed his fury in the black of night upon a force he thought responsible for the massacre. His actions triggered a war that would lead to the deaths of the soldiers who once followed him, as well as the lord whom he once admired so deeply.",
										"Outcast and disgraced, the paladin pursued a new path — to pursue not only justice, but vengeance — for to him, every life matters, and is deserving of both. In his view, both justice and vengeance are two sides to the same coin. Spreading his wings and embracing his true lineage and the powers bestowed upon him with it, the paladin, perhaps descended from the Eld Gods themselves, traveled for many years on personal vendetta. Eventually, the hinterlands and the savage, lawlessness beckoned. The paladin was pursuing a band of bandits at the edge of the wasteland containing The Living Tower when he became ensnared in its magic.",
										"Entering The Living Tower, he debated with Karthax for some time, arguing justice, law, and order are the only truths that matter, concepts the Eld God bemusedly discussed with the warrior. Sensing the paladin's bloodline and gifts, Karthax offered Raquel what he desired most — the power to avenge the innocent fallen — if he would but pit his wits and steel against that of his guests.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Raquel Saqat.} Raquel Saqat is bound by two binding principles: that each and every life matters, and that he must do (what he perceives to be) the greatest good, at any cost. The paladin may be found in clad shining steel armor, specially crafted to allow his feathered wings to spread from between his shoulders — other times with no breastplate at all. He is rigid in his views of right and wrong. If interacting with characters of lawful or good alignment he will often be agreeable and a powerful ally; chaotic- or evil-aligned characters are often goaded and taunted, perhaps even engaged outright if sufficiently provoked.

While demons of lesser power might have been ensnared in the Eld Gods spells, the multitude of minds now inhabiting the demon's shadowy form allowed them to evade the enchantments that otherwise would have rendered even a powerful demon a willing servant to the deity. Thus Raz'Drexin was unleashed once again upon the world to prey upon the hopes and dreams of its inhabitants.",
										"The escape of Raz'Drexin remained secret, despite clues to the continued existence of demonkind. Entire villages far away from the front lines were massacred by an unknown, malevolent force. Rumors of shadowy figures assaulting settlements became frequent, as did tales of individuals of otherwise sound mind waking one day suddenly either insane and prone to violent outbursts and speaking in unknown tongues or others merely becoming catatonic.",
										"At the height of the Great Cataclysm, the Eld Gods were consumed with their conflict as Raz'Drexin's influence began to grow. At long last, the demon saw the opening they had been waiting for — the Eld God responsible for the demon's imprisonment had become distracted and arrogant — and sent forth their elite guard to seemingly secure a glorious victory for themselves.",
										"Sensing vengeance at last was theirs, Raz'Drexin unleashed themselves upon the Eld God. The demon was preparing for the final blow but was driven off by the returning guard, disappearing once more into the shadows. Shorn of leadership and with their morale dealt a devastating blow, what surely would have been a glorious victory was turned into a resounding defeat, the forces of Order overcoming what had seemed insurmountable odds to drive their opponents away. It was this battle at the height of the Great Cataclysm that ultimately turned the tide toward Order.",
										"Despite not completely eliminating their former captor, Raz'Drexin continued with their nefarious deeds even when the Great Debate was at last settled. The outcome of the Great Cataclysm was more than the demon could hope for — their captor weakened, humiliated, and banished, a world torn asunder by fire and thus perfect to spread the influence of demonkind once again.",
										"For countless centuries after, Raz'Drexin lurked in the shadows, seeking ways to prepare for the inevitable rediscovery of this world by demonkind. Raz'Drexin constructed powerful artifacts with which to ensure that even if the demon was captured or destroyed, their essence would linger. Seemingly innocuous and mundane items were imbued with Raz'Drexin's power, that when used would infect the minds of those who possessed them. Enchanted mirrors, candles, and other objects used by seers and scryers allowed Raz'Drexin to slip into the minds of powerful mortals possessing magical gifts. In exchange for promises of untold power, these mortals would begin amassing a following that were the seeds of a mortal army loyal to demonkind — and Raz'Drexin, in particular.",
										"Despite their continued search for ways to prepare for a demonic invasion, Raz'Drexin remained unable to communicate with their extraplanar brethren. The demon searched the world for centuries, until they came across a crumbling tower. Sensing the lingering and hated presence of one of the Eld Gods, Raz'Drexin entered the tower. Karthax, recognizing the shadow demon as a key reason behind the triumph of Order, nonetheless held true to their vision of free will and offered the demon a bargain: the means to contact demonkind outside this world in exchange for their service within The Living Tower.",
										"Having searched desperately for a means to do just that, Raz'Drexin eagerly agreed before negotiating the terms of what defined service within The Living Tower. The demon was thus deceived, their spirit trapped once more by one of the Eld Gods within a floor of obsidian walls.",
										"While outwardly raging at their imprisonment once more, secretly the demon knew that at last they held the upper hand — for the seemingly mundane items imbued with their essence throughout the world would ensure that their influence would spread, and eventually the demon would be free once again — this time with a legion of followers. Karthax the Deceiver had perhaps, for once, been themselves deceived.",

Having consumed the minds of numerous beings, demon and mortal alike, the demon's telepathic voice consists of countless voices all desperately attempting to speak over each other and be heard. Only the very wise or intelligent can hope to discern the true voice of Raz'Drexin, and those of insufficient ability suffer terrible headaches from the relentless pressure applied to their minds.",
										"Raz'Drexin is malicious, cunning, and revels in driving mortal minds insane, turning fast friends and lovers against each other. While the influence of the demon is near, rest is impossible, as the demon's mind relentlessly seeks to penetrate into the hopes and dreams of mortals and thereby bend them to their will.

										"Garion was once a handsome human bard of some renown. Muscular, charming, with a finely sculpted beard, and piercing blue eyes, Garion sang and strummed a lute like few others, and many buildings were crammed with visitors hoping to catch a tune or three. From city to village, tavern to inn, Garion was perpetually restless and never tarried in one place for more than a fortnight.",
										"An accomplished gambler, Garion lost his coin as quickly as he could earn it more often than not. At times, the smooth-tongued bard would be able to worm his way out of delicate situations; at other times his approach met with less than desirable results from his perspective. It was one of these latter situations that found the bard needing to lay low for a while. Having heard of a booming new industry where perhaps his former business associates might not think to look (until things cooled off a bit),  Garion ventured north to the various mining settlements that sprung up seemingly overnight — rowdy taverns full of newly wealthy people sounded quite appealing.",
										"For a week or so, all was well until Garion's penchant for crossing the wrong individuals came to the fore over a rigged set of gaming dice, and, in the dead of night, the bard left for the next settlement. However, the bard was not so adept at navigating directions in the black of night and thus became hopelessly lost. Eventually, parched and in tattered rags, Garion found himself at the entrance to an abandoned tower.",
										"Karthax, disgusted by the pathetic whining mortal that somehow survived the wastelands long enough to venture into The Living Tower, offered to settle Garion's debts if he would spend a fortnight with a shadow. If the bard survived the utter black evil that was but an echo of Raz'Drexin's true self, the human would no doubt never whine again.",
										"Raz'Drexin, seeing a weak minded fool but one with a great deal of fame, set to the task of breaking the spirit and mind of Garion. Once broken completely, Raz'Drexin surmised, the foolish mortal could be a useful vassal for spreading his influence. Since this time, several visitors have come to this floor, and a possessed Garion has assaulted their minds by the will of Raz'Drexin; directing them to perform unspeakable acts against one another...until the screams cease. Afterwards, what remains is the telepathic presence of the demon, endlessly pressing against Garion's mind and taunting him with the heinous acts he's performed while controlled.",
										"Garion's body has also slowly been warped by Raz'Drexin's evil influence: Cloven hooves have replaced once muscular legs, a long, sinuous tail erupts from his lower back, a series of horns have sprouted from the human's skull, and his skin has begun to turn the color of twilight. However, what is  most disconcerting, is that Garion's once piercing, laughing blue eyes have been replaced with a dull,  milky glaze — that turns to jet once the demon  possesses his mind.",

										"Adventuring was not what the bards and minstrels described in the great ballads and sagas of elvenkind, as Arioch quickly found out. Rather than be rewarded for good deeds, Arioch quickly discovered that good deeds often go unnoticed, and there is much injustice in the world that cannot easily be overcome.",
										"Seeking simply to make a living rather than change the world, the elf quickly became angry and bitter at the injustices he saw. He turned to a mercenary life, where at least his deeds might be rewarded with a bit of coin at the end of the contract. Arioch took up the blade and stave.",
										"While on his travels, Arioch began to see at last what he missed all along — that yes, there is great wrong, and it is easy to see crime, abuse, discrimination, and inequality, but more difficult to see were the smaller, seemingly minor deeds in his youth that were easily discounted but made all the difference: the gentle acts of kindness, of sharing a humble meal with a stranger, and of welcoming a bitter elven mercenary into one's home on a bitterly cold night.",
										"Seeing the balance of right and wrong, ill deed and good, Arioch forged a different, perhaps gentler path. Rather than seething at injustice, Arioch instead began to try to understand the choices that led to ill deeds, as well as see their potential good outcome. Vice versa, a noble and altruistic deed might lead to a horrible act. Balance, the elf came to realize, is the only truth. He came to neither favor good nor evil, but instead acknowledge that both must be kept in balance — and if violence is required to keep either in check, so be it.",
										"Sensing an unbalance in nature, perhaps caused by yet another greedy scheme in which the wealthy merely exploit the land for their own gain, Arioch ventured to where he sensed the disturbance. Frontier mining camps and settlements not being the source, Arioch ventured into a barren wasteland, and before long came to The Living Tower. Sensing the tower itself as the disturbance that had slowly been growing in strength, the elf willingly entered without hesitation — much to the surprise of Karthax.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Arioch Morningstar.} Once a skilled mercenary and warrior, Arioch Morningstar has been on a long path seeking balance both within himself and for the world. In his youth, most who encountered the elf would have described him as aggressive, impulsive, and even reckless. However, with age comes wisdom.

								"The generation prior to the eruption of hostilities that marked the beginning of the Great Cataclysm was largely one of enlightenment. By this time, many mortals had been educated in the ways of art, literature, and magic. Universities and libraries were home to countless learned beings of all races who gathered in peace to debate religion and philosophy. The mortal races, by and large, were at peace, unified within the knowledge that beings far greater than themselves clearly wanted the mortal races to flourish under their benevolent gaze.",
								"During this time, three sisters were born to a family of modest means. Despite their common upbringing, the trio were wildly different and yet tightly bound together in sisterhood that seemed unbreakable. Kyreen, the eldest, was disciplined, studious, and of even temperament. The youngest, Faradel, was impulsive, arrogant, and aggressive, and particularly competitive with her sisters. The middle sister, Avilnar, was aloof and disinterested in the ways of the world, yet a mischief-maker extraordinaire.",
								"From a young age, the three sisters showed a natural aptitude and draw toward the arcane, and thus were attended to by the finest tutors and scholars their parents could provide. They were educated in all areas of the arts — literature, poetry, theater, history, debate, and magic. Yet where their hearts truly lay was in philosophy and religion and the deep interconnection of these topics with the Eld Gods. The sisters spent countless hours debating their will.",
								"Faradel favored the argument that the weak should be ruled by the strong, and that law and order would naturally fall into place based on the strength of the prevailing chaos of nature. Kyreen agreed that the strong should prevail but the will of the Eld Gods superseded natural law; thus their Order must be obeyed at all times. Avilnar deeply enjoyed antagonizing the two opposing views, and her views often seemed (and were) fickle and chaotic.",
								"Seeing these three argue the finer points of the Great Debate caused several of the Nine Eld Gods to take great interest in them. The Eld Gods began to weave their influence over the minds of the three, subtly affecting their thoughts, for the Eld Gods sensed the three sisters could become valuable servants to spread their word to other mortals. Over time, the Eld Gods' influence poisoned their minds, twisting the sisters' lively debate into furious arguments, pitting them against each other.",
								"By the time the Great Cataclysm erupted, the three were so opposed that any bond of sisterhood had long disintegrated, and they joined their patrons to wage war upon each other.",
								"When the ashes settled and Order prevailed, Kyreen was tasked with hunting down Faradel and Avilnar, who in turn sought vengeance against each other. Faradel, injured in one encounter, entered The Living Tower in exchange for sanctuary, not knowing her sisters would enter in pursuit of each other. Known as the Sisters of the Cataclysm, they have been bound in an endless hunt for each other within The Living Tower."

They have been engaged in an endless hunt for each other, each emerging victorious over another many times over the centuries. To maintain their burning hatred for one another, each time a victor emerges from their unending hunt Karthax wipes their memories, resurrects the fallen, and allows the hunt to begin once again. Karthax has also blocked their memories with respect to their patrons — when questioned about the Eld Gods they will pause, stare blankly for a moment, then proceed as though the question was never asked.",

										"The eldest of the three sisters of the Cataclysm, Kyreen is disciplined and intelligent, yet rigid in thought and lacks flexibility to see other perspectives. While debating her sisters and later hunting them down, this proved both an advantage and a potential weakness, in that her single-minded determination made her a relentless foe in combat but left her vulnerable to the unpredictable tendencies of her sisters and their tactics.",
										"A particularly pious individual, Kyreen was in the midst of deeply examining the origins of the Eld Gods when war broke out and was convinced in the requirement for strict laws, predetermined in the Eld God's boundless wisdom, that would maintain justice for all mortal races and ensure peace. Kyreen thus also devoted herself to many hours of meditation and prayer, and through her piety has access to powerful magic to both aid others and bring divine justice to the forces of chaos.",
										"During the Great Cataclysm, her patron presented her with an enchanted warhammer that glows with radiant power whenever creatures of a chaotic nature are near, which assisted Kyreen in hunting down and exterminating countless foes during the Cataclysm.",
										"Clad in a heavy suit of plate, Kyreen made for a fearsome sight at the vanguard of several of the bloodiest battles of the Great Cataclysm and became revered as a leader by her allies and reviled by opposing forces.",
										"Lawful mortal warriors, priests, clerics, and paladins were drawn to Kyreen while the forces of Order were gathering. Her followers were blindly faithful and loyal to her, obeying Kyreen's every command regardless of impact to others.",
										"After the Great Cataclysm, Kyreen was tasked with hunting down and exterminating the remaining forces aligned with chaos and free will; thus she led an elite cadre of hunters to pursue these remnants and eventually her own sisters. Slowly, this force was whittled down to just her, the last of the sisters to enter The Living Tower — exchanging her presence within for the opportunity to at last confront her sisters.",
										"{@b Roleplaying Kyreen.} Her sisters would have described Kyreen as pious, elegant, single-minded, and inflexible before they came to hate one another. Now they would describe her as a self-righteous fool blinded by an outdated and altruistic concept of what the world should be as opposed to what it is. Kyreen speaks boldly and confidently and comes across as a competent and confident leader. She leads through strength, however she views leadership through force and does not tolerate subordinates or other beings questioning her thoughts, actions, and tactics.",
										"Kyreen is particularly suspicious of creatures of a chaotic alignment, and mistrusts them as she is unable to predict what actions such creatures might take.",
										"She may nonetheless ally with such beings, though only for so long as Kyreen can tolerate what she perceives as their self-centered motivations. Eventually, though, all must obey her commands and subject themselves to her.",
										"Kyreen can be articulated as follows:",
										{

												"- When describing Avilnar:  \"{@i Oh my foolhardy little sister...she never was of sound mind. This left it to be twisted by whatever creature she served. The atrocities she has committed in their name must be avenged! She must be exterminated!}\"",
												"- When interacting with characters of a lawful alignment: *\"You! If you be followers of the law you will join me in bringing justice to my sisters. Only then can we rebuild the world!\" and \"I will not tolerate questioning from you — I command, you obey; that is the law in my presence!\"",
												"- When interacting with characters of a chaotic alignment (suspiciously): \"I will be clear - I do not trust you. There will come a time when you will choose to submit to the law or you will become my enemy.\""
											]
										},
										"Kyreen will ally herself with chaotic-aligned characters only until her other sisters have been vanquished, at which point she will turn on and attack such characters exclusively, ignoring lawful-aligned allies — these she will view as poor, misguided souls who will be released from the twisted influence of chaos once it has been eliminated.",

										"As the youngest sister of three, Faradel always felt the need to keep up with her older sisters. In particular, she always admired Kyreen, whose intelligence and calm demeanor always seemed to keep Faradel's impulsive and tempestuous nature in check. From childhood onward Faradel was brash, quick to anger, and seldom hesitated to speak her mind where others might pause and debate if a wiser course of action might be in order. She was insatiably curious, and her mind, while it was not nearly as structured or disciplined as Kyreen's allowed her to see less conventional paths forward. This served her particularly well during the battles of the Great Cataclysm, where forces under her command would employ unorthodox tactics and often score decisive victories against otherwise superior forces.",
										"While Kyreen was pious and noble, Faradel believed that morals and rules would ultimately be the downfall of free will — the end would ultimately justify the means. In her view, the Eld Gods had allowed and encouraged the mortal races to explore their own, which was a clear license for power to rule and be overthrown in its own time by those more cunning or worthy.",
										"It was her numerous victories that ultimately led to her downfall, however. Becoming emboldened by her successes in battle, Faradel became more arrogant, more convinced in her superiority and that none could match her tactically. That is, until she was routed by an equally unorthodox ambush by Avilnar, who took advantage of a particularly brutal battle between forces led by Kyreen and Faradel — their forces both decimated by wave after wave of chaotic energies unleashed by Alvinar's band of corsairs.",
										"In her desperation, her forces weakened, demoralized, and near complete collapse, Faradel unleashed magic uncovered in ancient tomes long forgotten in the depths of one of the many monasteries she studied in. Whispering words of great power, she summoned forth the souls of the slain and offered them the opportunity to return to the world of the living once again. To the horror of the pitiful survivors on the field of battle, the dead walked the earth once more. Legions of her soldiers rose, along with a fewer number of Kyreen's and Alvinar's forces, who fled in the face of a renewed onslaught. This battle finally drew Faradel completely into darkness, warping and disfiguring her once comely figure into a twisted visage that matched her now completely blackened heart.",
										"Creatures whose souls are tainted by darkness were drawn to Faradel - magi thirsting for knowledge, mortals seeking unending life, worshippers of demons, and other such beings.",
										"Eventually a great final battle rained holy fire upon the Faradel's legions and her forces were exterminated. Faradel fled, seeking to recoup her losses and amass another freshly risen army. Relentlessly pursued by Kyreen to prevent such an occurrence, Faradel entered The Living Tower, bartering for time — a bargain Karthax was all too willing to accept.",

										"The middle of the three sisters, as a child Avilnar was always caught between her two sisters — disciplined, noble, virtuous Kyreen on one hand and impulsive, chaotic, and arrogant Faradel on the other. In Avilnar's view, both were bickering over trivial matters. The Eld Gods...debated over trivial matters. The only things that truly mattered were the actions of an individual in the moment, and each living creature was part of an interwoven web of singular choices carried out each day that created a grand masterpiece — the tapestry of life.",
										"Avilnar spent hours on end observing her siblings and their constant competition, inserting a few well chosen phrases, contradictions, and controversies into Kyreen's and Faradel's sometimes heated arguments. Both Kyreen and Faradel found Avilnar's comments infuriating to say the least, for it seemed the middle sibling's perspectives were constantly changing and mutable, never consistent enough to hold any substance. It seemed every other statement delivered by Avilnar was so outlandish it couldn't possibly hold any merit, and was delivered in such a nonchalant way that the two bickering siblings could never quite tell if Avilnar meant what she said — or if she was just manipulating the others.",
										"Avilnar took great delight in egging her siblings on, sometimes even merrily skipping away while leaving the others fuming at her — and each other. A keen observer of behavior, Avilnar mastered the ability to manipulate and antagonize others, bending them to her will sometimes for the sheer sake of doing so.",
										"Her mind was particularly adept at understanding and manipulating the subtler forces of magic — those of enchantments, illusions, and transmutations. Manipulating the thoughts and senses of other beings was as effortless to Avilnar as summoning a flicker of flame was to an evoker — thus she delighted in casting subtle spells upon others, enticing them to perform outlandish acts to the bewilderment of those around her.",
										"While she slept, Karthax planted visions in Avilnar's subconscious — hardening her to the inevitable conflict looming on the horizon. Avilnar's mind shifted from a once carefree, mischievous soul to one prepared for the grim realities of war.",
										"When the Great Cataclysm erupted, despite both her siblings imploring Avilnar to join them, she declined, each earning their hatred in return. Where both Kyreen and Faradel rose to lead great armies against one another, Avilnar led a modest force of corsairs determined to ensure freedom for all. Her forces, vastly outnumbered, relied on their cunning - setting elaborate traps, misdirecting through carefully-wrought illusions and enchantments, and eliminating key targets from either side in an effort to ensure neither side gained advantage for any length of time.",
										"All manner of mortals joined Avilnar's cause of their own volition, seeking neither power through force nor restricting the freedoms of others, but instead only the freedom to choose their own path — right or wrong be damned, they would make up their own minds. Thieves, assassins, warriors, mages, and free-minded folk of all races followed her.",
										"Both Kyreen and Faradel grew frustrated with repeated attacks against their forces by Avilnar's corsairs — they were unpredictable as her comments during their debates. Both cursed their sister, who carried out, at times, ruthless and unsavory acts against each. In return, both sent forth many hunters attempting to eliminate the thorn in their sides, but each time the master manipulator, weaver of illusions and enchantments, would dance out of their grasp.",

Descended from a line of powerful shamans, Hjálmŷr quickly rose through the tribal ranks, and despite standing only 18-feet-tall (small for a frost giant), quickly becoming a warrior renowned not only for his ferocity and prowess in battle, but also for his cunning and intelligence. More than a worthy opponent to other rivals within his clan, Hjálmŷr quickly earned the respect of older and more seasoned warriors.",
								"Never satisfied with achieving renown as a warrior, in his arrogance Hjálmŷr set his mind on a more enticing prize — being recognized as Jarl of his tribe. After amassing a significant following, Hjálmŷr set about challenging the incumbent Jarl for their seat at the warrior's throne — a hallowed throne constructed of dragon bones and the weapons of conquered enemies. Despite his cunning, Hjálmŷr was blinded by arrogance and lust for the coveted throne — and was thus betrayed by his followers. After a fierce battle, Hjálmŷr’s followers were slain.",

Should Hjálmŷr even step foot in their lands again, he would be forever denied his place at the All-Father’s table with his ancestors.",

Rendered immortal by Karthax, Hjálmŷr has lost all concept of time, and will often ramble of his deeds to any who listen (willingly or not) — his retinue of Draugr, his winter wolf, Varsúlfr (the only creature Hjálmŷr might actually care about), the two ice mephits, Borr and Rán (servants of Karthax who occasionally visit Hjálmŷr’s floor on behalf of Karthax), and any beings who happen to be teleported to the floor for Karthax’s testing or entertainment.",
										"Standing 18-feet tall, Hjálmŷr wears a great helm capped with the horns crafted of dragon spine bones tipped with claws from the same, and wears battle scarred mail. His eyes glow with an unearthly hue behind irises the color of glacial ice, and glint with malice and cunning. A long white beard, carefully braided, frames his pale blue skin. Hjálmŷr bears a massive greataxe that is never far from his reach, its blade pitted from hundreds of battles.",

										"As with all his playthings, Hjálmŷr eventually tires of such games, and challenges his “guests” to combat in his fighting pit. Inevitably Hjálmŷr is victorious, often playing with his exhausted and weaker opponents while boasting of his strength before delivering the final blow. In a gruesome twist, the dead are butchered and spit-roasted, to be served to Hjálmŷr’s remaining guests, Varsúlfr, and the Draugr.",

								"Before the Great Cataclysm, the region in which The Living Tower stands was once a hot, humid jungle near a dormant volcano. Countless species of plants and animals thrived in this environment, and the tribes of mortal species that lived within had an abundance of food. Deep lakes and rivers crisscrossed the land filled with fish, eels, and waterfowl; the great, ancient trees supported countless species of animals both beneath on the shadowy jungle floor and within a canopy that produced a diversity of fruit and other foods undreamed of. Medicinal plants were common, and the denizens of this jungle were prosperous.",
								"Despite the relative peace of this jungle, there were nonetheless dangerous threats throughout. Large caimans lurked amidst calmer waterways, great cats stalked game from the dense foliage, and even the inhabitants of the jungle would on occasion wage war amongst themselves. The greatest of these predators were the fiercely territorial hydras — ravenous multi-headed reptilian creatures that dwelled within some of the more boggy wetlands within the region.",
								"The tribes that dwelled within this region were for the most part isolated from greater society, and despite numerous pilgrimages from the so-called civilized outer world to enlighten these reclusive bands in the ways of the Eld Gods, seldom could they find them. Frequently such visitors were afflicted with virulent jungle fevers, lost within the tangle and driven mad before eventually finding their way out once again, or simply never heard from again.",
								"Despite limited contact with the outside world and even less knowledge of events therein, the Great Cataclysm would decimate this ecosystem. In their fury, the Eld Gods raised a great fire mountain from within the depths of the jungle, one that would spew forth countless tons of ash and poisonous sulfurous gas into the atmosphere. The violent magics that raised this volcano laid waste to the jungle, annihilating almost all of the region and those within in but a few short days. Creatures that could flee did so, but most perished — engulfed in a pyroclastic flow that consumed their bodies or showered them with molten rock. Only a few pitiful remnants of this once glorious tribute to life would survive its transformation into a barren wasteland of ash and dust.",
								"At the edge of the jungle, a hydra nest nestled against a peaceful riverbank that contained a single egg was miraculously spared from the pyroclastic flow and volcanic bombs that rained down upon the region. Hatching amidst the chaos and destruction, and just as the choking volcanic gasses were dissipating, the young hydra found an abundance of food. Not needing to hunt nor compete with other predators, the hydra — the last of its kind — rapidly grew to an enormous size.",
								"When Karthax constructed The Living Tower, the hydra, known as Khuzza, was beginning to run out of easy prey. Seeing the great creature and knowing that the species would soon become extinct without divine intervention, Karthax brought Khuzza within. Countless visitors to the tower have since satiated the great reptile."

The primordial beings, reduced to bickering amongst themselves and vying for supremacy, scattered across the seas. Alone, Acythylass came to an underwater maelstrom that proved to be an underwater portal to...elsewhere.",
										"Seeing an opportunity to flee this realm and perhaps build a new civilization, more glorious than the last, Acythylass entered the maelstrom, emerging into a sea teeming with an abundance of life the likes they had never before seen.",
										"The primordial set about their task with fervor, conquering the simple-minded underwater denizens of this world with ease, consuming the minds of those who would not bend to their will. Known to their subjects only as the Ancient One, they set about crafting a new underwater empire. More than that, armed with the knowledge of the existence of other worlds, perhaps linked by portals such as the one that brought them here, Acythylass began scheming to conquer not only the seas of this world, but of others as well.",
										"Over several centuries, Acythylass consolidated their power, bred formidable offspring containing the genetic memory of their hermaphroditic parent, and carved out an empire in the northern seas that surface dwellers feared to sail with their flimsy wooden vessels. Those who were bold, foolish, or plain stupid enough to try to traverse these waters quickly met a watery grave. Those who were strong enough to resist the Ancient One's minions were psionically dominated and kept as servitors who would obey their every whim.",
										"While the ongoing events of the surface world seldom concerned Acythylass, as they would later learn an event known as the Great Cataclysm boiled the seas and once again annihilated centuries of effort.",
										"Rockslides buried the newly constructed cities Acythylass' followers had toiled to build. Multiple maelstroms opened and consumed the Ancient One's progeny, their fate unknown. Tidal waves swept all but a pitiful few of Acythylass' followers onto the shore where they perished beneath a withering sun.",
										"Acythylass fled once again, seeking refuge within a complex underwater cavern system beneath the main continent of this world. There, safe from the ravages unleashed by the Great Cataclysm, Acythylass tentatively reached out with their psionic energies, touching the mind of a powerful being that seemed...familiar.",
										"Following this mind, Acythylass came to the foundation of a relatively newly constructed tower, perhaps only a few years old. The Ancient One, wary of the presence of a powerful so-called god, also saw opportunity, for it seemed the god-like presence that identified itself as Karthax was unfamiliar with the primordials.",
										"Likewise, Karthax saw an opportunity engaging with the primordial, for never had they encountered such a strange being whose mind was so foreign to that of the mortal denizens of this world.",
										"The two beings — Ancient One and Eld God — thus began slowly learning about one another, always probing, always debating, always seeking an advantage or secret knowledge the other might possess. Allowing this strange being from elsewhere access at will to the submerged cavern system beneath the wastelands and into The Living Tower suited Karthax well. Not only did the Eld God slowly begin to learn the ways of a being so unlike anything they encountered, but it also provided the Eld God with the opportunity to debate with a highly intelligent being. In exchange, Acythylass was provided with shelter and — unbenownst to Karthax — the opportunity to study, and perhaps even seek vengeance, against one of the self-proclaimed Gods that had ruined the Ancient One's rule so many millennia ago.",

										"A somewhat prickly and grumpy gnomish diviner, Fargrim Sunffbottom comes from a long line of gnomes renowned for their magical abilities — though his family is perhaps even better known for their unique brew of turnip ale. Standing a proud 3 feet 6 inches tall and weighing a healthy 3 stone (42 lbs), Fargrim is both proud and stubborn. Gnomish children in his village would frequently evade Fargrim whenever he would trundle down the streets and alleys with the support of his staff, ducking away from his glare - for he had a fearsome reputation for being impatient and ornery, particularly with children — for the old gnome had little time for shenanigans and pranks.",
										"Yet despite his outward hard exterior and gruffness, the bearded, white-haired old gnome cares deeply about his family, friends, and village — including the children, as well.",
										"While content to run the brewery that had been in his family for several generations, Fargrim would on occasion seek to glimpse into the future. On most occasions but a few fleeting images would come to the gnome; yet on one fateful night, perhaps notable for his testing of a new ale recipe perhaps a bit excessively, a vision as clear as the spring water used in his brews came to Fargrim.",
										"First, Fargrim beheld the sight of a teetering stone tower in a blasted wasteland. He beheld an image of a being of light, so bright and beautiful they nearly blinded him. Reaching out, the being released nine gemstones: four (a pearl, ruby, diamond, and onyx) burned brightly with an inner fire, levitating above the others. One, what appeared to be jade, barely levitated and only hinted at an inner light. Three (a sapphire, emerald, and topaz) remained in the being's hand, clasped tightly. The final gemstone — an ever-changing opal that reflected the being's light into countless colors, levitated apart from the others.",
										"Countless images then rapidly flashed before Fargrim's eyes: of legions of horned, cloven-footed creatures bearing vicious weapons, of great armies clashing. Of bound and chained beings of many races, marching along worn paths into the distance while carrion crows circled above.",
										 "Fargrim beheld images of great battles — of strife and conflict. Such visions brought the old gnome to his knees, before he saw the tower once more — illuminated by a ray of light that caused it to crumble and collapse. The last of the premonitions was a telepathic voice reaching out to him: \"The time is nigh. In the north, the fate of free will shall be decided.\"",
										 "Head throbbing, Fargrim awoke in a cold sweat from what he had beheld. Determined to prevent the calamities he had just witnessed from coming to pass, that very day the wizard set forth, trusty staff in hand and the adventurer's pack from his father upon his back.",
										 "For several months, Fargrim traveled north, always inquiring from the locals if they knew of a crumbling tower in a barren wasteland, yet most simply looked queerly at the gnome — clearly too old for adventuring — as though he was a lunatic. One local, however, told Fargrim of a new mining venture to the north, where gemstones of great value had been discovered. Perhaps there Fargrim might find the answers he sought?",
										 "With newfound hope and determination, Fargrim continued onward, his divinations burned into his memories.",
										 "Within one of the many taverns set up to quench the thirst of the newly wealthy miners, Fargrim came across a charming adventurer on the same path, who had also heard of the crumbling tower. The stranger accompanied Fargrim into the barrens, where they finally — exhausted, dusty, and with food and water depleted — came to the crumbling tower Fargrim beheld in his vision. Turning to thank his companion, Fargrim was shocked to find he had disappeared with nary a trace.",
										 "Entering the tower, Fargrim was immediately addressed by a telepathic voice: \"I have been waiting...welcome to my tower! Enter, and you may find the answers you seek...\"",
										 "Completely alone and armed with only his wits and skills as a wizard, Fargrim entered without hesitation.",
										 "His wiles have allowed the lone gnome to outwit many of the foes in The Living Tower — having escaped from Krul'Thunk, the three sisters, as well as Jarl Hjálmŷr before coming to this floor, which Fargrim is just beginning to explore.",

Only a few teeth remain in a smile that is no doubt meant as kindly, but from your experiences, such creatures would sooner tear into your flesh than aid you.",
								"Panic sets in, yet the figure simply rests a gentle hand upon your brow and softly whispers:  \"{@i Rest, lost soul. Answers will come when you are ready.}\"",

								"Below is the Karthax's Quips table: a d100 table containing phases, riddles, taunts, omens, and even possibly a few words of wisdom that can be used to help Karthax narrate while players are exploring The Living Tower. The intention with Karthax's Quips table is for Game Masters to roll on it and then read aloud the phrase indicated. While a quip might not be relevant to the floor the party is currently exploring, they have been created to be general enough so that they will foreshadow what is to come, or serve as a quick reminder of what was already experienced.",
								"The idea for this table is to add a dynamic nature to Karthax and make this omniscient being feel \"alive\", but not everything needs to be so serious. Some of the responses, narrated when the party is in a sticky situation, can be used to great comic effect. A GM might wish to read through the tables before running Karthax: The Living Tower; picking and choosing phrases in advance.",
								"The general outline of the d100 Karthax's Quips table is for each group of 10 quips to refer to their numbered floor. For example, taunts 11-19 refer to the 1st Floor, 20-29 refer to the 2nd Floor, and so-on. Taunts 01-09 are general, and refer to the tower itself, or are simply Karthax's general thoughts. The table has been organized in this manner so GMs can easily pick taunts for a current or upcoming floor if they wish. In addition to the d100 Karthax's Quips table, there are nine d6 Karthax's Tips tables, one for each floor of The Living Tower. These d6 tables are specific to their corresponding floor, and can be used while a party is exploring that particular floor.",

										"Given the plethora of non-player characters and their conflicting motives within The Living Tower, the easiest way to utilize the Karthax's Taunts table is to give Karthax their own \"voice\" and \"personality\", which is consistent throughout the adventure. This can be as simple as having a unique accent for Karthax, or perhaps Karthax represents someone in your campaign that the players will recognize and is now embodied by the tower. Either way, being consistent in your delivery of Karthax's quips will let your players get onboard with the sarcastic nature and have a bit of fun conversing with Karthax as they explore The Living Tower.",
