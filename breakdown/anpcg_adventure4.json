						"This adventure is centered around the tomb of a virtuous, honorable – and deceased – person of note. In the description below, the hero is assumed to be Piergeiron the Paladinson, but you can find more examples of suitable heroes on pg.101.",
						"When Piergeiron the Paladinson, Open Lord of Waterdeep, died of old age in 1379 DR, he was interred in a tomb in Westwood, a few days ride north of Waterdeep along the Long Road. The beloved leader was buried with his magic arms and armor to keep them safe until the realm needed them once more. To dissuade tomb robbers, but still make it possible for true and noble heroes to visit Piergeiron and even retrieve the items in times of great need, the tomb contains riddles, traps and guardians to test the might and mettle of any who dares enter, allowing only heroes of noble character to find Piergeiron’s physical remains.",
						"For more than a century, these protective measures have worked as intended, allowing Piergeiron to rest peacefully.",
						"Indeed, most have forgotten about the tomb of the famous hero. One who has not forgotten, however, is Dagult Neverember. The disgruntled noble was deposed as Open Lord of Waterdeep by Laeral Silverhand in 1489 DR, and while he remains Lord Protector of Neverwinter, Dagult still holds a grudge.",
						"Embittered, and growing increasingly tyrannical, Dagult Neverember has decided that Piergeiron’s treasures should rightfully belong to him. Hesitant to openly provoke Waterdeep and his powerful predecessor by sending Neverwinter soldiers to raid the hero’s tomb, Dagult has hired a band of nefarious adventurers to do his dirty work.",
						"Led by the ruthless Tarquin, the Black Blade – as this band of adventurers call themselves – are now attempting to break into Piergeiron’s tomb and claim his long-lost treasures."

Mirt offers the adventurers a prize of 200 gp each if they can bring the items back to Waterdeep for safekeeping.

In the Foe’s Room, the party will face dangerous foes, yet only be allowed entry once they realize that the worst foe is always oneself. In the Liar’s Room, the characters will seemingly have found their prize only to discover that the treasures before them are lies, crafted to burn those who falsely claim to know the hero. In the end, the tomb robbers show up to steal the tomb’s treasures from the characters.

Here, Tarquin turns his magic battleaxe, the black blade, into Nuyk the quasit (MM pg.63), and commands the fiend to invisibly spy on the party. Tarquin instructs Nuyk to return to him once the characters have bypassed all the tomb’s defenses and reached the hero’s treasures. The Black Blade’s plan is to learn how the party solves the tomb’s riddles, so they can enter the tomb behind them and ambush the characters when they reach the hero’s last resting place in ‘T4. Liar’s Room’. Because the quasit is invisible, it is highly unlikely the characters will notice they are being spied on.",

						"Immediately in front of you, an elevated walkway leads to a glowing stone pedestal on a platform in the room’s centre. At the far end of the chamber, small steppingstones span a luminescent pool to a crescent-shaped section of floor. On this small isle sits an elaborate stone sarcophagus, surrounded by unimaginable treasures: coffers overflowing with gold and platinum, scrolls and books, as well as swords, shields and other items, their strong glow and exquisite make hinting at their magical power. At the southern end of the chamber a small set of stairs lead to a platform before a large mural depicting scene of battle. At the northern end of the chamber, several stairs lead up to a balcony just below the chamber's ceiling, ending at another platform and a mural showing a scene with several figures in joyous celebration.",
						"This room presents itself as the hero’s last resting place, but that is not entirely true. The hero lies entombed behind the mural atop the balcony by the northern wall, where only those who knows the hero’s life and history will think to look.",
						"{@b Stone Pedestal}. This stone pedestal sheds dim, blue light in a 30-foot radius. Inscribed on its slanted surface is the following poem in Common:",
						"“Welcome friend, see clear where I lie,",
						"Among my greatest treasure, my tomb you find, Resting forever, where lies won’t reach.”",
						"This poem gives subtle hints about how to find the hero’s actual tomb (see ‘True Sarcophagus’ below).",
						"{@b Murals}. Most of this room’s murals show fictitious events:",
						"Piergeiron ruthlessly executing captive enemy soldiers, flying into war on the back of a red dragon, and conquering civilized settlements by sword and torch. A creature that examines the murals and succeeds on a {@b DC 13 Intelligence (History) check} recognizes that these images are lies. A character who has spent time looking at the murals in ‘T1. Entry Hall’, or who has previously succeeded on an Intelligence (History) check pertaining to the hero, has advantage on this check.",
						"{@b Secret Door}. Only one mural, which decorates a 10-by-10foot section of the wall atop the northern balcony, shows a true event: an aging Piergeiron in joyous celebration alongside his daughter, Aleena Paladinstar and several of his friends, such as the Archmage Khelben Blackstaff and the adventurer Mirt. Piergeiron is smiling and raising a hand in salute to a crowd of cheering Waterdhavians. This scene is referenced in the poem – Piergeiron’s friends and family are his greatest treasures, and because this is the highest point in the room, the lava (or ‘lies’) won’t reach it (see ‘False Sarcophagus’). A character that investigates the mural up close notices that Paladinson’s raised hand is a pressure plate. If pushed, the wall slides open to reveal Piergeiron’s true sarcophagus.",
						"{@b True Sarcophagus}. This small, musty room bears no ornaments, and contains nothing except for a sturdy stone sarcophagus. Within the sarcophagus, Piergeiron lies perfectly preserved by a permanent casting of the spell gentle repose. Interred with the hero are his magic items:",
						"commander’s hope, ally’s reflection, and soldier’s luck. There are no more traps or riddles in the tomb – any character can simply reach down and take the items.",
						"{@b False Sarcophagus}. The sarcophagus on the isle at the eastern end of the room is a decoy, meant to lure tomb robbers to their death. The treasures scattered around it are all made of painted iron, and the only enchantments on them are simple light spells to make them appear magical. The sarcophagus is empty.",
						"If the false sarcophagus or any of the treasure surrounding it is touched, the doors back to ‘T3. Foe’s Room’ slams shut and become magically sealed for 1 minute. Have the characters roll initiative as all the water in the chamber turns into smoldering lava and begins rising toward the ceiling.",
						"At initiative 20 each round after the first, the lava rises 5 feet until it reaches just to the edge of the northern balcony at initiative 20 on the fifth round. The lava remains here during the sixth round, before it begins receding at the same pace at the start of the seventh round.",
						"At first glance, this trap seems like a death sentence for anyone inside the room. However, the lava is a lie – an illusion that works much like the spell phantasmal force. The lava exists only in the mind of the characters, who think they can hear, smell, and even feel the lava’s heat. A creature ‘submerged’ in the lava is blinded, moves at half speed, and takes 1d6 psychic damage (which it perceives as fire damage), when it enters the lava for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. At any point on its turn, a creature can use its action to examine the illusion with a {@b DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check}. On a success, the creature realizes that the lava is an illusion, and is no longer affected by it.",
						"The illusion, which is considered a 5th level spell, can be suppressed for 1 hour with a casting of dispel magic.",
						"Otherwise, the illusion persists until the lava has receded back to water level again after 1 minute, upon which the doors leading out of the room to ‘T3. Foe’s Room’ also reopen.",
						"{@b Hint: Liar’s Room Puzzle}",
						"Hopefully, the characters will be wary of the sarcophagus and treasures directly in front of them, once they have read the poem on the stone pedestal. If the lava illusion is triggered, the fact that the lava never reaches the balcony where the secret door is should serve as another clue.",
						"If the characters still can’t figure out where the true tomb is, you can have the hero deliver the treasures to the characters magically during their encounter with the Black Blade (see ‘The Hero’s Items’), or after their encounter with the villains."

						"While the characters have been exploring the hero’s tomb, the quasit Nuyk has been trailing them invisibly. When they found the way into ‘T4. Liar’s Room’, Nuyk hurried back to fetch Tarquin and the rest of the Black Blade. A short while later – quickly bypassing the traps and riddles in the other rooms – the Black Blade shows up to confront the party in ‘T4. Liar’s Room’.",
						"{@b Stealth}. Upon their arrival, Tarquin ([draconic renegade]), Janiel ([moonlit shadow]), and Orwen ([sewer druid]) take position by the door and wait for an opportune moment to ambush the party, such as when the characters either find the true sarcophagus, or trigger the illusion on the false sarcophagus.",
						"Have the villains make a group {@b Dexterity (Stealth) check} against the party’s passive Perception to determine how many characters are surprised once combat breaks out.",
						"{@b Diplomacy}. If the characters clearly see Tarquin and the rest of the band entering the room, Tarquin attempts diplomacy first. He gloats about how he has tricked the characters into doing his dirty work for him, before offering them the opportunity to leave with their lives if they lay down their weapons and surrender.",
						"In truth, Tarquin intends to slaughter the party once they have been disarmed, which a character succeeding on a {@b DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check} realizes as soon as he says it.",
						"{@b Combat}. In combat, Tarquin and the rest of the Black Blade focuses on getting the tomb’s treasure and may even inadvertently trigger the illusion on the false treasure as they do so. While tough and persistent, the tomb robbers are not suicidal. Any member of the Black Blade reduced to less than a third of their maximum hit points attempts to flee. If unable to do so, they throw down their weapons in surrender, if they think it will save their lives.",
						"{@b Treasure}. Each member of the Black Blade carries the arms and armor featured in their statistics, explorer’s backpacks with 3 rations, and a pouch containing 1d4 onyxes (50 gp each) and 2d20 gp. Orwen also has a potion of resistance (cold) and Tarquin has the black blade.",
						"{@b Note: Final Encounter Difficulty}",
						"The final encounter with the Black Blade can be very tough, especially if it occurs while illusory lava is filling the chamber. While the best encounters are usually those that challenge the characters most, a total party kill is rarely fun for anyone.",
						"Below are some ways you can adjust the difficulty of the final encounter to avoid catastrophe.",
						"{@b Adjusting Hit Points}. The Black Blade would have had to face one of their members’ evil reflection in ‘T3. Foe’s Room’. You can use this encounter as an excuse to bring down their hit points or take away uses of their spells or class features.",
						"{@b Using the Illusion}. If the characters are falling for the illusion and losing the fight because of it, you can allow any player character that takes damage from the lava to roll a {@b DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check} to disbelieve it, without using an action to do so. Simultaneously, you can also have the members of the Black Blade waste their actions attempting to examine the lava or escape from it, rather than attack the party.",
						"{@b The Hero’s Blessing}. You can also use the characters’ heroic struggle with the NPCs to further enhance the mystic nature of the tomb. If faring badly, you can have the hero’s disembodied voice sounds in each player character’s head:",
						"“There’s greatness inside you – all you have to do is believe in yourself”, granting them 10 temporary hit points and the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required) for 10 minutes.",
						"{@b The Hero’s Items}. The hero’s magical items may also lend aid to the characters. If they have found the items before encountering the Black Blade, you can allow the characters to instantly attune to the items, so they can use them in combat. If they haven’t found the items yet, you can also have the weapon, shield and boots appear magically in the hands of one or more characters during the battle, as the hero’s disembodied voice says: “Your cause is just, adventurers. May these items serve you in your fight against evil, as they once served me.”"

A band of nefarious tomb robbers are trying to steal the magic treasures but have so far been stymied by the tomb’s defenses.",

						"{@b Adaptable Adventure Hooks}",

In this case, the Black Blade could be hired by High Overseer Thavius Kreeg shortly before his defeat at the hands of the heroes.",

She asks the characters to go to the tomb and secure the items, lest they fall into the hands of wrongdoers.",

						"{@b Storm King's Thunder}",

						"The characters can learn about the tomb from the giant wizard Zephyros (who can even fly the characters to the edge of the Westwood) at the end of Chapter 1. The quest for Piergeiron’s items can also replace quest hooks given by NPCs at the end of Chapter 2, such as Urgala Meltimer in Triboar, Duvessa Shane in Bryn Shander, or Zi Liang in Goldenfields. The characters may also receive the quest from the heroic frost giant Harshnag once they meet up with him during Chapter 3.",

						"{@b Waterdeep: Dragon Heist}",

The faction is acting on rumors that Lord Dagult Neverember – ousted Open Lord of Waterdeep – wants to spite Waterdeep by robbing their famed hero’s tomb.",
