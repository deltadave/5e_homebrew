A stronach has no sapience but is imbued with latent magic.",
								"When a stronach ends up in a location with moisture, over time it will leach the area of nutrients and create a bog. A bog stronach will begin to mindlessly attempt to create entities in its own image, likely a vestigial trait of godhood. Since it can't create true clones it sends out runners, much like rhizomes on a plant, that grow aberrant facsimiles of the stronach.",
								"Stronach clones absorb nutrients and magic energy to feed the parent. One way they do this is by producing pearls, rough granite-like spheres with iridescent interiors that are eventually absorbed by the stronach for their energy. The most fascinating thing about these pearls is their magical homing quality. Stomach pearls are highly sought after by navigators the world over. It is relatively easy to harvest a pearl by damaging the clone that produced it to a certain point. However, a pearl is rendered useless if its clone is destroyed. Although the stronach is mindless, it has defenses, as do its clones. And while a bog stronach and its clones are one organism, they are treated like separate creatures for combat.",

When a god dies and floats in the cosmos it is inert. When circumstances allow it to find a plane rich in life and magic, some spark is triggered and over time extensions of the stronach reach out into its new environment to collect whatever energy it can find and absorb.",

Stronach clones are tethered to the stronach by a stone-like fiber underground that is virtually impossible to sever. Because of this, clones have limited movement but whatever movement they have is relative to their age and size. Once a clone reaches a certain age, it withers and dies and is replaced by a new growth.",

They are excellent grapplers and will attempt to grab and drown any creature brave enough to attempt to harvest pearls from them. They may be blind but the have tremorsense that allows them to be aware of anything or anyone approaching them or the stronach.",

The sage pondered that the marriage would create a symbiotic relationship that could solve both entities’ deficiencies and create a complete productive being with the ghost’s personality. He imagined an eternally grateful creature beholding to the wizard that would staff his estate and that he could perhaps even mentor to learn, or relearn, magic, whatever the case being in their previous life.",

However, the ghosts were quickly driven into madness by their new prison, no longer able to escape into the ethereal plane, and were soon contaminated by the dark magic that had animated their shells in the first place.

				"These lawful undertakers of the realm are not particularly benevolent. Clerics of Repose concern themselves with the matters of passing and ushering the spirit from the mortal world to the next. They abhor undead or anything that interferes with the natural course of the spirit in life and in death. Although children and the unwashed often fear these armed clergy, in their ubiquitous black and charcoal gray robes with symbols of death adorning them, the sage and experienced know that they bear no malice towards the average person. Only necromancers and those who deal in souls, such as devils and fiends need to fear their divine wrath.",
				"They serve deities of the dead and as their service grows, they are granted powers that those who play with souls and the undead fear. Many of their orders produce special potions that do not heal but work as a prophylactic against death.",
				"Clerics of Repose can raise the dead themselves but only do so to restore a lawful life to an unjust death, and always for a price. They are the undertakers of the realm and perform rites of passing on the battlefield and on deathbeds alike. The donations they receive for such services, and their potions, go towards maintaining their gothic temples where acolytes are trained in the esoteric divine domain of repose.",
